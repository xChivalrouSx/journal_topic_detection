Introduction  N-Queens is a combinatorics problem extended from the 8-Queens problem [1, 2].  The N-Queens   problem requires the combination of N queens on the NxN board such that none of the queens can attack  the other. The problem was widely investigated by famous mathematicians such as Gauss [1, 2], Polya  [3], and Lucas [4]. Likewise, the N-Queens problem is the subject of current research, including quantum  computation [5-7], and genetic algorithm [8, 9]. Additionally, the N-Queens problem is utilized in                                                              * e-posta: 1  sguldal@adiyaman.edu.tr ORCID ID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4247-0786                  2  mml005@uab.edu ORCID ID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9980-2326                   3  mtanik@uab.edu ORCID ID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9437-725X    mailto:sguldal@adiyaman.edu.tr https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4247-0786 mailto:mml005@uab.edu https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9980-2326 mailto:mtanik@uab.edu https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9437-725X   15                                                                                                          S.

The N-Queens problem is one of the well-known examples of an  NP-hard type problem. This is a class of problem that is “at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP”  [11].     In this study, we investigated the relational information between cells if there is a queen placed.  For that, the Girvan-Newman Clustering (GNC) algorithm was applied to the queen graph.   The queen graph was converted from the considered board. Every cell was indexed by a number  to represent the nodes in the graph. Edges were generated from the queen moves, so that rows, columns,  and diagonal elements had edges connected to them. An example of this is shown in Figure 1, in which  an 8x8 board is presented by indexed cells. The corresponding graph is shown in Figure 2. Every cell is  represented by a node in the graph. Edges connect the overlapping nodes.   8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   6 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   5 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32   4 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40   3 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48   2 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56   1 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64    a b c d e f g h   Figure 1. 8x8 board is defined by indexing every cell with the sequence of numbers from 1 to 64     The 8-Queens graph is color-coded with respect to degrees of nodes and is presented in Figure 2.  The first ring (purple colored nodes) contains the nodes with 21 degrees. The second ring (green colored  nodes) contains the nodes with 23 degrees. The third-degree nodes (orange-colored nodes) contain the  nodes with 25 degrees. Lastly, the nodes in the center (blue colored nodes) are the nodes with 27 degrees.  This is the maximum capacity that a node can cover on an 8x8 board. A similar ring form is presented  for all the Queen graphs.

Queen Graphs’ Degree Revisit  The Girvan-Newman Clustering (GNC) algorithm uses edge- betweenness to extract the   subnetworks in a specified graph. In this way, the degree of the graph (queen graphs in this study)  inherently defines the clusters. Figure 2 shows the degree of the nodes' proportional distribution of the 8- Queens graph. While the outer ring with degree 21 is the majority, the nodes with degree 27, the center  of the board, contains the least number of nodes in the 8-Queens graph.    The distinct type of degree distribution of the Queen graphs is shown with respect to the specified  graph in Figure 3. 1-Queens and 2-Queens each have one distinct degree of nodes which have 0 and 3  degrees respectively.   With the increasing number of nodes for greater cells, more distinct degrees emerge. 3-Queens has  2 distinct degrees: 6 and 8. Similarly, 4-Queens has 2 distinct degrees: 9 and 11. The increase in the  distinct degrees follows a continuous trend as shown in Figure 4.      Figure 3 Proportionality of degrees for the given graph distribution gap closes by increasing the board   size     Figure 4. Increase of Distinct Degree of N-Queens (N=1-30)   3.    Girvan-Newman Clustering of Queens Graphs  There are several clustering algorithms, which are used to extract information about the   relationships in the networks. Such algorithms include minimum-cut [14], hierarchical clustering [15],  modularity maximization [16], statistical inference [17], Girvan–Newman Clustering (GNC) algorithm  [12], and clique-based methods [18].   In our study, we applied GNC to identify the relations between queens. GNC is a divisive method  that uses edge betweenness. It progressively removes edges one-by-one until no edge is left in the given     17                                                                                                          S. Güldal, M. M. Lipscomb, M. M. Tanik     ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 12 (2020) 14-23     graph. In each step, edge betweennesses are recalculated, and edge(s) with maximum edge betweenness  is or are removed. Additionally, a modularity score is calculated in each step so that the graph with the  maximum modularity score corresponds to the most stable combination of the collection of clusters.    The clusters represent the strongly connected community of queens. Functional relations are  defined by modularity in small communities. Our analysis was done by means of Gephi with a GNC  plugin [19]. We applied 2 to 30-Queens. Further details of applications will be discussed in the Results  and Discussion section that follows.   There are various modularity scoring algorithms. In our calculations, the modularity score, which  is a measure of network quality, is formulated as follows [20]:      𝑄𝑄 = 1 2 ��𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 −  𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 𝑀𝑀  � 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖       (1)      where 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 is 1 if 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑗𝑗 are in the same group. M stands for the number of edges in the graph. 𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖  is the degree of node 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 is the degree of node 𝑗𝑗. 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the adjacency matrix.    4.    Results and discussion  In our study, we investigated the functional relations between queens by means of the Girvan-  Newman Clustering (GNC) algorithm. The most stable sub-communities (a.k.a. clusters) were identified  based on the modularity score.   GNC is not applicable to 1-Queen since no edge exists. Thus, our investigation was limited from  2 to 30. In Figure 6, applications of GNC on N-Queens graphs (N=2-6 and 16-18) are shown. 2-Queens  is the graph which has 4 nodes and 6 edges. Removing the first and the second edges from the 2-Queens  graph has no effect on the modularity score, as shown in Figure 6.a. Removing the rest of the edges  reduces the modularity. Thus, the maximum modularity score for 2-Queens graph is 0.0, and there is only  1 community.    Figure 6.b presents the GNC application on a 3-Queens graph. The 3-Queens graph has 9 nodes  and 28 edges. Modularity score jumps from 0 to 0.06122446 by the 12th edge. 2 clusters are identified  with the maximum modularity score. The major cluster has 5 nodes, and the minor cluster has 4 nodes,  which are at the corners of the board.    The 4-Queens graph consists of 16 nodes and 76 edges.  It reaches to the maximum modularity  score, 0.012551993, with the 7 clusters (See Figure 6.c). 4-Queens’ modularity score follows a  combination of 2-Queens and 3-Queens. The modularity score of 4-Queens decreases to a negative value  which indicates less interaction and then increases to the maximum value, 0.012551993.    The other noticeable behavior is that one of the clusters contains the majority of the queens (10 out  of 16). On the other hand, the other 6 clusters are made of single queens. This is a similar trend in the  greater boards except for 17-Queens, which is discussed in the following paragraphs.    In Figure 6.d, the GNC as applied to the 5-Queens problem, and the most stable clustered graph,  is shown. 5-Queens has 25 nodes and 160 edges. The modularity score did not change across a relatively  long period of time. The graph loses an edge in every step. One reason could be the symmetric structure  of the edges. GNC results show that there are 7 clusters with a maximum modularity score of 0.07257812.  Although the number of clusters is the same as the 4-Queens, a higher maximum modularity score is  found for 5-Queens. There are 2 major clusters that have 8 and 12 nodes. The other 5 clusters have only  one node.    The next example, 6-Queens, is shown in Figure 6.e. The 6-Queens graph has 36 nodes and 290  edges. The 6-Queens graph has 15 clusters with 0.032401927 maximum modularity score. There is only  one major community, which has 25 elements. This resembles from 5-Queens to 6-Queens added to the  board weakens the connectivenes. All clusters have only one node, the major cluster.       S. Güldal, M. M. Lipscomb, M. M. Tanik                                                                                                              18   ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 12 (2020) 14-23     For greater board slides, the trend follows with an exception, that being 17-Queens. 16-Queens  graph is built by 256 nodes and 6320 edges, and 18-Queens graph is built by 324 nodes and 9078 edges.  16-Queens and 18-Queens are divided 122 and 172 communities with the maximum modularity scores  of 0.054113388 and 0.05395335, respectively. Both graphs are made of one major graph and many  clusters with single nodes. The 17-Queens graph, on the other hand, has 289 nodes and 7616 edges, and  it is divided into 82 clusters with 0.18264371 maximum modularity score. 12 of all clusters contain 17  nodes, which are aligned on the row on the board, so there are 12 major clusters. One cluster contains 16  nodes, which are similar in the same row. The rest of the clusters, 69 clusters, have one node only.  Additionally, there is a steady drop in modularity score for every step of GNC after the maximum  modularity score. GNC shows the central cells on the board have stronger relations than surrounding  cells.    Similar clustering is seen for 27,  and 28-Queens, and partially for 25, 26, and 29-Queens. This  highlights the strong relationship for being in the same row, but that is not the case for the N-Queens  problem.   We have given some of the GNC applications in detail, but our investigation is not limited to them.  The overall results are summarized in Figure 7 and Figure 8.   The results of the GNC tells us relational appropriateness to place queens. Figure 6.d presents a  GNC application on 5-Queens. The result shows that the first 2 columns (or rows if we consider rotational  symmetry) of the first 4 rows/columns are strongly related, and the next 3 columns/rows of the first 4  rows/columns are strongly related. This implies that the first two columns/rows cannot have queens closer  to each other. Similarly, the next three columns/rows cannot have 3 queens close to each other.    In Figure 5, all 10 solutions of 5-Queens are listed in the form of arrays. Orders in the arrays show  the row number, and the numbers stand for the column number of the particular queen. Additionally, the  first 4 solutions are shown in the form of a board. In Figure 6.d, GNC results reflect the solution since  placed queens column 1 and column 2 cannot be listed consecutively since they are in the same  community (Green colored community). Likewise, columns 3, 4, and 5 cannot be listed one after the  other (Purple colored community). This is clearly shown in the 5-Queens solutions.

We intend to understand the strength of queens’ relations when they are placed on the board. When we  emphasize the boundaries between cells, we can develop a divide-and-conqueror algorithm to solve the  N-Queens problem. The GNC algorithm extracts the cluster by edge betweenness and modularity score  of the graph.    In Figure 7, the maximum modularity score increases slowly with an increase in board size  compared to the increase in the number of clusters (See Figure 8). This emphasizes that the stability of  the clusters is similar to increasing the board size with the number of communities. Additionally, 17- Queens have an intense peak with a comparatively small decrease in the number of communities.   Figure 8 shows the number of clusters. There is a dramatic increase with respect to the board size  because of the number of one node clusters.      Figure 7.

Conclusion  In this paper, we have applied the Girvan-Newman Clustering algorithm to extract the functional   relations between queens.

Application results show no explicit correlation between the board size and the number of  communities in the scope of our range.   The examination of Queen graphs shows no direct relationship with the number of communities  and the maximum modularity score. Thus, it extracts irregularity about the relations.   In future studies, we purpose to develop an algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem under the  light of this study. The core of the planned algorithm is based on the divide-and-conqueror by  communities identified in the Girvan-Newman Clustering algorithm. Dividing to the small parts is not a  common case for combinatorics problems.    Acknowledgment  The authors declare no conflict of interest.    References   [1] C. F. Gauß, H. C. Schumacher, and C.

Introduction   Forest resources provide numerous and multifaceted benefits to society through its functions,  such as the production of wood raw materials, recreation, aesthetics, community health, hydrological,  conservation of wildlife, and biodiversity. Thus, forest management bears various costs while  providing these benefits through forestry activities [1]. It is necessary to estimate the value of the  deprived forest benefits due to the allocation of forests to mining, and to determine the cost value to  restore the damaged forest to its former quality [2]. Following this determination, in order to carry out  mining operating activities in forest lands, some fees are received for the forestlands used. It is  foreseen that these costs will be spent on making real community benefiti.   Mining investors do not only pay forest fees to carry out mining operating activities in Turkey.  Apart from varying depending on the overlapping of areas, they may face the payment status of  expropriation fees, private land fees, or pasture fees. There are also different kinds of expenses such as  operating license fees, waste management costs, rehabilitation costs, environmental compliance  assurance, share of municipality, state's right, and taxes that mining enterprises are obliged to pay as a  result of land useii [7].   In many countries where the mining sector are developing, all property permits, including forest  permits received for the mining activities paid during the project, do not exceed 2% of the total mining  investment amounts [8, 9]. But, due to the effects of changes in the legislation, there are concrete  examples in only forest lands in Turkey that exceed 40-45% of this rate [10, 11].   Forest fees required in Turkey are very high compared to worldwide [12, 13, 14]. These sums  paid as the forest fee annually in Turkey exceed the approximate average cost of the land purchase  where they are located [15]. In the vicinity of the forest area, privately-owned property can be  approximately purchased for USD 9000-18000 depending on its hectare, or on it’s being a wetland or  a barren land, hence free of hire purchase [16]. For instance, during a 20-year mining project in  Turkey, the fee paid for the forest can reach up to approximately 50-70 times more than the purchase  price of the land owned by the private property in the region because of the continuously increasing  forest land permit fee [17]. In the case of mining operations being in non-forest properties (e.  agriculture, pasture, public/private land..), about more than 20 times differences may occur in the fees  to be paid. In this situation, it becomes a critical factor affecting whether the aforementioned mining  projects will be carried out or not [14]. In this case, it is not possible for domestic and foreign mining  investors to provide economic operability in the mining investments they plan.     At the beginning of the 20th century, the minimum operable cut-off grades were, for example, 30  g/t for gold, 3% for copper, and 12% for zinc [18]. Today, as a result of the increasing demand and  prices for minerals, gold mines of less than 0.5-1 g/ton, copper mines with 0.5% cut-off grade, zinc  mines with 2% cut-off grade are now economically operable [19]. However, the higher the costs of  mining enterprises get, the higher minimum cut-off grade of the ore that they will produce, in parallel  with the cost increase, tends to get. This situation will mean the closure of some mining enterprises,  leaving the economic operability.     The most important goal of each company is to make maximum profit. The profit or loss of the  company depends on two factors. The first is the cost incurred for the amount of goods it will produce  and sell. The second one is the income obtained from the goods sold [20]. From the point of mining  enterprises, the second factor depends on the mineral prices determined by the stock exchanges based  on the mineral demand in the world. The first and more important factor in terms of investment risk is  that mining enterprises may be exposed to the influence of mining policies and legislation in the  country.     T. D. Yıldız                                                                                                                                              26     ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 12 (2020) 24-33   In order for the investment project, which is one of the important tools in economic  development, to reach the targets (minimum time, minimum cost, minimum capacity)  determined in  the project [21]; subsequent regulations due to legislation should not be outside the expected.   In terms of expenditures and risks, the most important activity group to be considered regarding  mining is pre-production activities [22]. These activities include the forest permit process. In case the  mining operating activities overlap with forestlands in Turkey, it is beneficial to determine how much  of a share the fees paid during the investment period from the expenses of the relevant permit period  takes within the amounts of mining investment. In this paper:   • Determine how much each and total of the different types of forest fees paid during the  investment period by the mining enterprises had shared in the amounts of the mining investment in  order to perform mining activities in forestlands in Turkeyiii,    • Determine whether these shares vary according to different mineral groups,    • Determine whether these shares have high in mining investment,    • Despite the prediction of the deduction in the forest land permit fee in the last legislative  arrangement, it is aimed to discuss the necessity of a deduction in the paid forest fees during the  investment period.   First of all, in line with this aim, questions were asked to the mining enterprises through the  ""Survey Monkey"" survey program in May, June, and July 2018 in Turkey to identify such legislation  problems in the mining sector and to make a comparative analysis for the results. Some of these  questions are about the forest fees to be paid for mining activities in forestlands.    The survey questions were answered by the relevant departments of the mining companies. The  answers were transferred collectively to the survey program, regardless of which companies answered  the survey, and it wasn’t known what responses were given to the questions. Some of the 97 mining  enterprises have chosen not to answer some questions. Respectively, 83 and 82 mining enterprises  answered the ‘’reforestation fees’’ and ‘’other fees’’ question examined in the study. Along with these  fees, the enterprises that announce their investment amounts are respectively 66 and 63 mining  enterprises. These data were analyzed according to different mineral groups. The mineral groups  stipulated by the legislation in Turkey are presented in summary (Table 1).      Table 1. Mineral groups in Turkish mining legislation (summary)iv[5].   Ist  Group   Minerals    I (a) Sand and Gravel     I (b) Clays and rocks used in cement and ceramics industries    IInd  Group   Minerals     II (a) Aggregate rocks and rocks for ready-mix concrete and asphalt    II (b) Dimension stones, Marble, Travertine, Granite, Andesite, Basalt etc.    II (c) Ground/milled rocks for industrial use (Calcite, etc.)   IIIrd Group Minerals Salts (incl. sea, lake, and spring water), CO2 gas (except geothermal, natural gas and petroleum areas, Hydrogen Sulfide    IVth  Group   Minerals     IV (a) Industrial minerals     IV (b) Peat, Lignite, Hard Coal, Anthracite, Asphaltite, Bituminous Schist/Shale Shale, Coccolith/Sapropel     IV (c) Metallic ores, rare earth elements/minerals    IV (ç) Radioactive minerals    Vth Group Minerals Precious and semi-precious stones        27                                                                                                                                              T. D. Yıldız     ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 12 (2020) 24-33   In the calculation, the average values of forest fee ranges stated in the survey responses of each  mining enterprise were proportioned to total investment amounts. So, average values were calculated  for each mineral group.   2. Last Legislative Amendments on Forest Fees   In Turkey, it is projected that temporary facilities built out of necessity and depending on the  period of the license to carry out mining operating activities in the forest areas are given permission  within the framework set forth by Forest Law No. 6831, Regulation for Implementation of Forest Law  and Forest Permitting Regulationv [26, 27, 28]. One of the most significant problems of the mining  sector is the unpredictable forest permit processes and extremely high forest fees [29].   Law No. 7061 that came into force on December 05, 2017 and Article 9 of Mining Law No.  3213 in Turkey have been changed. As a result of this change, a deduction was made in the fees taken  from the mining permit in forestlandsvi. Based on this, in the implementing regulation of Article 16 of  Forest Law No. 6831, a change was also made with the Regulations put forth on July 06, 2018. The  matter of how and under which circumstances the deduction will be applied are discussed in Article 8.  Subsequently, a Circular of the GDF dated August 02, 2018 was published.   According to this with exceptions, for all mineral groups, from all permits, half of the land  permit fees shall be taken for the first ten years starting from the date on which the mining operation  permit is issued. So, on a site where the mining operation permit is issued after the date of 05th  December 2017, 50% discount will be applied to all forest permits to be given for 10 years by  MAPEG (General Directorate of Mining and Petroleum Affairs), mining operation permit date. If the  operation permit is in a forest permit field issued before December 05, 2017; after the date of  operation permit issued by ""MAPEG"" starting from December 05, 2017, a discount will be applied for  the remaining period of ten years.   However, due to the implementation of the aforementioned Circular by the General Directorate  of Forestry, no deduction is applied in the license areas whose first operation permit date (10 years  before the effective date of Law No. 7061) is before the date December 05, 2007. This situation  eliminated not only the vested rights of mining investors but also removed competition and equal  employment conditions between the ones who were given operation permit before the date December  05, 2017 and the ones who were given the permit after this datevii [9].   Nevertheless, in the inscription added to Paragraph 6 of Article 47 of the Law No. 7061 and to  Article 9 of Mining Law, there was no mention of ''Operating Permissions First Regulated Date'', and  no regulation was made regarding whether the operation permit was issued before the Law No. 7061  or not [9]. Therefore, in the aforementioned Article of the Law, there is no regulation found regarding  ”no deduction will be applied for licenses issued before 2007” as well as regarding “deductions will be  applied for the remaining period of 10 years in the operation permit issued before 2017”. See on  legislative proposals on this matter [14].   Several Mining Associations, particularly the Turkey Miners Association (TMD), suggest the  forest land permit fees required from mining enterprises are deducted [13, 14] or –instead of every  year- are taken only once during the investment period. Forest land permit fees can be evaluated as an  operating period expense. In this case, the share of reforestation fees from forest costs paid by mining  enterprises during the investment period and the share of other fees within the amounts of mining  investment should be examined.   3. Forest Costs Paid During the Investment Period: Their Ratio to the Amounts of Mining  Investment     T. D. Yıldız                                                                                                                                              28     ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 12 (2020) 24-33   3.1. Reforestation Fees   3.1.1 Calculation of Reforestation Fee   In forestlands, the reforestation fee is taken once per m². It is determined that the desired  reforestation fee for the mining permits given in the forestlands will be spent for the reforestation of  these areas. The reforestation fee changes every year for mining enterprises and this fee rises every  year according to the rate of the minimum wage in Turkey. The calculation of the ""reforestation fee""  in the Forest Regulation is stated as; ""one-day normal working payment for Workers over 16 years old  that is established to second half of the year by"" General Directorate of Minimum Wage Detection  Commission"" is, the multiplication of the permit area with reforestation unit hectare fee that  determined by the multiplication of minimum wages by the 294 days/hectare coefficient.   As seen from this definition, as the minimum wage increases, the reforestation fee that is asked  from the miner are increased in Turkey as wellviii. Accordingly, the reforestation fee is 2.5073 TLix/m2  as of 2019.   3.1.2 Reforestation Fees in Turkey & Their Ratio to Mining Investment Amounts   The survey question, ""How much the total reforestation fee you paid / will pay?"" is asked to  mining enterprises in Turkey. Eighty-three mining enterprises answered to this question. The  distribution of these responses, according to different mineral groups, is shown below (Fig. 1).        Figure 1. Reforestation fees paid by mining enterprisesx    Reforestation fees are envisaged to be given only once at the beginning of the mining operation.  Considering this situation, when the amounts paid as ''reforestation fees'' by each mining enterprises  answering the survey individually are proportioned to their investment amounts, the following results  are obtained on the basis of mineral groups (Table 2).        29                                                                                                                                              T. D. Yıldız     ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 12 (2020) 24-33   Table 2. Reforestation costs & averages of investment amounts.   Mineral groups  Number of   mining  Enterprises   Average of  total   investment  amounts (TL)   Average of  reforestation   fees (TL)   The ratio of  reforestation costs to   total investment  amounts (%)   Group 2 (a) 16 39.687.500 950.000 5.40   Group 2 (b) 20 63.425.000 1.975.000 3.21   Group 4 (a) 8 498.312.500 6.500.000 3.43   Group 4 (b) 14 432.346.154 3.475.000 1.22   Group 4 (c) 8 522.750.000 3.132.143 4.00   For all mineral group 66 268.068.182 2.715.086 3.44      As can be seen in the table, the weighted average of the ""ratio of reforestation fees to investment  amounts"" paid by the mining enterprises is 3.44%. This rate alone shows that the ‘’reforestation fee’’  has a high share in the mining investment amount in Turkey. The fact that the investment amounts of  2nd Group of minerals were less than the investment amounts of 4th Group of minerals was finalized  with the situation that the 2nd Group of minerals have a higher share –compared to other groups in  general- in investment amount of reforestation fee. Thus, as shown in the figure below clearly, it is  seen that this share declined gradually from the 2nd Group of minerals to the 4th Group of minerals  (Fig. 2).        Figure 2. The ratio of reforestation costs to investment amounts   It is seen that there is a moderate polynomial correlation (R2 = 0.69) between the mineral groups  and the ratio of reforestation fees to investment amounts. The reason why this change varies among  the mineral groups is the variability in the forest permit areas to be operated especially in mining.        T. D.

Other Fees   For performing mining operations in forestlands; there are other costs paid to the forest  administration (such as security depositxi, service fee, and report fee). The question ""How much is the  total amount fee of security deposit, service, and report that you paid/will pay to Forestry  Administration? (Excluding land permit fee and reforestation fee)"" was asked to mining enterprises.  The answers of 82 mining enterprises according to different mineral groups, are shown below (Fig. 3).

Going  from the 1st mineral group to the 4th mineral group, the average investment amounts increase. In fact,  this situation resulted in a decrease in the average value of the ratio of other fees to investment amount  going from the 1st group to the 4th group of minerals (Fig. 4).         31                                                                                                                                              T.

The ratio of other fees to investment amount   There is a weak polynomial correlation (R2 = 0.55) between the ratio of the other fees to the  investment amounts and the average value (%) of the mineral groups. However, from the 2nd group to  the 4th group, these values give an idea about the ratio changing among the mineral groups.   4. Conclusion and Suggestions   Reforestation and other fees, which are the forest fees paid by mining enterprises during the  investment period, have undeniable shares in the investment amounts of these enterprises. The ratios  of these fees to investment amounts vary among mineral groups. The ratio of reforestation fee to  investment amount varies between mineral groups between 1.22-5.40%. In other fees, this share is  between 0.16-1.09%. There are other land use costs paid during the investment period as well as taxes  such as forest land permit fees and state right paid each year during the operational period. In the  presence of these costs, the “reforestation fee” and “other fees” examined in the study may create a  higher investment risk especially for mineral groups with low investment amounts. This situation  shows that forest costs paid during the investment period are a cost item that can economically push  more the 2nd Group mining enterprises whose investment amounts are lower compared to other  mineral groups. Things to do can be summarized as follows:    • First of all, in the direction of the recommendation of the mining sector, the land permit fees  should be taken once, instead of every year, within the forest costs like the other fees specified outside  this fee.    • Considering that required forest costs are high at specified rates only during the investment  period in Turkey, being one of these fees, lowering the reforestation fee to a more reasonable level – for example deducting in half- with the legislation can make a positive contribution to the  development of the mining sector. At this point, determining both the reforestation fee and security  deposit, which is one of the other fees, in accordance with the minimum wage rate, can result in a high  increase in these fees each year. Instead of this rate, it would be more appropriate if the increase in  fees is at least to the extent of annually inflation rate declared in Turkey. Above all, it is beneficial to  make such calculations with scientific approaches considering the mining and forestry criteria.    • Thus, when considering the mining operating data analyzed in the study, the ratio of ‘’  reforestation fee’’ to the total investment amount is 1.72% instead of 3.44% (Due to 50% discount of  reforestation fee). Thus, these fee deductions to be made can reduce the mining investment risks. Even  if these percentages may adversely affect the mining enterprises economically and financially, in the     T. D.

Introduction   Panel radiators have been mainly preferred to heating for big areas and individual places to  transfer boiler energy directly this places. efficiency of the panel radiators are so crucial for the heating  system, therefore convector sequence and total heat transfer surface area affects directly transferred  energy. In order to increase thermal performance and distribution, alternative fluids may be considered  as additionally with water. In the solar systems ethylene glycol is commonly used like auto engines to  prevent freezing during the winter. But propylene glycol is as well evaluated that is less non-toxic than  ethylene glycol, however, it is more expensive but has superiorities for the human health. If the  propylene glycol is added to water with ratio of 50% freezing point of the mixed fluid is -33°C. [1]      The aim of this study, testing propylene glycol as an additive with 10% ratio, with mixed water  of the panel radiator, and mixed solution thermal distribution and performance has been compared with  common full water 100%  systems. The reason of the propylene glycol selection is, being more  appropriate for human health than ethylene glycol and has same affection on decreasing the freezing  point of the water which is advantageous when the home or heating area are not used throughout the  winter time by the members [1].   Altuntop, made an academic study, which compares physical and thermal properties of ethylene  and propylene glycol fluids. Both fluids are used to decrease freezing point of water when they are used  as additive. Although both of them have same thermal properties, it is mentioned about hazardous  features of ethylene glycol for the human health especially for using it in solar water heating systems,  in case it combines the used-water. Due to having less non-toxic and harmful features, propylene glycol  usage is recommended instead of ethylene glycol even it is more expensive. The water of the  installations aren’t changed frequently unless any leakage or defect is not happened on the systems [1].    Yiven, Zishuai and the others, made a comparison between radiator varieties about thermal  performance and efficiency whose types are cast-iron radiator, steel radiator and copper-aluminium  radiator. Radiator sizes and flow conditions are adjusted identical and for the simulation, the software  which is named as DeST-h is used. According to results, it is understood that cast iron radiator is found  better than cooper aluminium type about thermal performance [2].   Embaye and the others made an academic study about investigating effect of pulse flow input on  the energy for the panel radiators. A panel radiator which has 0.5 x0.3 m dimensions have been analysed  by numeric method by CFD method with Comsol software, and the results show good agreement with  the literature, only 2.14% deviation is found. Water inlet velocity value is increased to 0.05 m/s than  0.035 m/s with pulsed flow. These two scenarios are analysed under same conditions; it is investigated  that thermal performance of pulsed flow scenario is increased about 20% than existing one. These results  prove, pulse flow behaviours have good advantages for inlet fluids of the panel radiators. [3].   Yılmaz, made an analytic analysis thermal affection about using polyurethane insulation plate on  the building wall where panel radiators are assembled this surface. Heating capacity is calculated for the  building, when the wall in uninsulated, the heat transfer from the wall to atmosphere is calculated that  197.7 Watt energy is transferred to atmosphere from the wall, if the wall is insulated by polyurethane  plates under same conditions, the heat transfer value is calculated as 75.6 Watt. In conclusion, involving  on the wall the polyurethane insulation panel, the heat loss is decreased about 61.7%. It is emphasized  that insulation is so crucial to sustainability of the energy resources. [4].   Kılıç and the others, made an analytical and numeric analysis on the common panel radiator in  order to develop more compact, all calculations were done compatible with EN 442 and Fluent is used  for CFD analysis. Consequently, about thermal performance they found 5% deviation between the  results and for the both calculations, it is investigated that thermal and temperature output have good  agreement with experimental data [5].      47                                                                                                                 H. S. Çelik, Z. Çelik, M. Uçar     ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 12 (2020) 44-55   Kibar, has an academic study about panel radiator performance analysis in the mosques numerical  with CFD software. It is assumed inlet temperature of the radiators 60 °C and the mosque are dimensions  are 20x20 m, height is 29.5 m, the system. As a result of this study, after 1 and 1.5 hours, it is investigated  that heated air is rised higher than 2 meters, therefore, it is understood that, using panel radiators are not  appropriate solution for the mosques [6].   2. Material and Method   Panel radiator is firstly analysed with the pure water as ratio of 100% fluid, accordingly propylene  glycol is involved the internal fluid and the results are compared.   In Figure 1, the panel radiator 1 m length and 0.6 meter height is shown.  The inlet fluid temperature is  adjusted 75 °C which panel radiators are so efficient under these conditions.      Figure 1. Panel radiator (1mx0.6m)   2.1. Theory   Analytic analyses are considered for the cyclindiric pipes of panel radiator as a simple view. In  the numerical analyses the flow is assumed as steady state and non-compressible form. Between the first  and second scenario; particularly the kinematic viscosity has difference properly due to adding  propylene glycol. All the theory have crucial inputs for the numerical analysises.

Reynolds number defines flow characteristic as laminar or turbulent. Based on the characteristic, Nusselt  number equation is changed. When the Reynolds number is smaller than 2300 for the inlet flow, the  flow region is laminar. The equation 2 is shown below.

Panel radiators are located same geometry and located 20 °C constant  temperature ambient conditions. The viscos method is selected as realizable k- ε   model as a result of  having superiority for the spinned and opposite pressurized gradients.

In Figure 2, the model is indicated. Inlet and outlet pipes are enlarged due to providing rather  homogenous fluids of the mixture.     51                                                                                                                 H.

Panel radiator model and fluid input and output points   The numerical analysis must have independence from grid quantities in purpose of providing  stable results which have good agreement with real circumstances. Therefore, mesh quantity is defined  for the both scenarios based on water outlet temperature. In Figure 3, mesh optimization is shown. As it  is seen, within 20 million mesh quantity till 25 million, water outlet temperature of the panel radiator is  found same value. It proves at least mesh quantity should be 20 million. Consequently, 21 million mesh  quantity is defined for both scenarios to make homogenous solution with optimum solution time for the  most convenient comparison.        Figure 3.

Grid structure of the model      The CFD analysis is completed for both scenarios under same condition and parameters. Velocity,  Pressure and Temperature contours are compared for both scenarios. Fluid thermo-physical properties  are different, therefore it is expected to find pressure contours difference and focus on temperature  contours modifications in order to understand propylene glycol impression on heat distribution. All  solution limitations are adjusted to same values to investigate differences obviously via colours.   Velocity contours under same limits, for both scenario are shown in Figure 5.

Pressure contours: a. 100% Water fluid, b. 90% Water +10% Propylene glycol fluid   Based on the results about the pressure contours, It is investigated pressure of the fluid is  increased with additive affection. Pressure loss between, inlet and outlet fluids are variable. It is  supposed, this difference may be come from flow characteristics change of the fluids, because of  changing viscosity change by additive.    Temperature contours under same limits, for both scenarios are shown in Figure 7.

Temperature contours: a. 100% Water, b. 90% Water +10% Propylene glycol fluid   It is found that the temperature of the fluid is more homogenous for the channel pipes due to  additive affection. even, it is added only 10% ratio, panel surface has nearly same temperature  distribution is more superior than pure water fluid under identical conditions. but this issue doesn’t  depend on heat transfer performance like outlet temperatures of fluids.    3. Conclusions and Suggestions    Numerical analysis are realized by Fluent software for both scenarios. The affection of the propylene  glycol has been researched and investigated with pros and cons. Even, it is added with 10% ratio of all  mixture, the difference is noticed easily from pressure and temperature contours. Values are indicated  in Table 4.          H. S. Çelik, Z. Çelik, M.

Heat transfer  performance of pure water is more about 12% than the mixed version. However, by additive both  freezing point is decreased, and heat distribution is more homogenous than pure water that is  investigated from thermal contours. The main reason of the thermal performance loss may be having  less thermal conductivity of the additive than water. In conclusion, alternative fluids which are non- toxic and have more thermal conductivity than water may be performed and evaluated by their utilisation  for these sort of systems. Even, heat transfer performance loss may be neglected due to having  homogenous thermal distribution and decreasing freezing point for the domestic internally heating  systems. By this additives, radiators can present more comfortable heating and the fluid makes the  installation more safe for the freezing , when the owners leave it temporarily during the winter. These  alternative additives should be researched to increasing both performance and life time of the installation  with appliances. The scenarios will be extended about mixing ratio of fluids for the next studies in  purpose of analysing parametric values widely.

Smart grids are spreading rapidly in the industry thanks to their ability to reduce  global warming and eliminate environmental constraints. With these network applications, the energy obtained  from the sources is established with or without network connection and the energy is maximized. Smart grids can  operate autonomously in combination with or separated from the conventional grid system. It can also be used in  applications where there are both AC source, DC source and hybrid AC/DC source energy systems. In this study,  DC grid system connected to IEEE 33 bus test system is designed and analyzed. The power flow values of the  hybrid AC/DC system are obtained.

Introduction    Desire to provide quality and economic electrical energy throughout the world has been a subject  of constant concern. From industry to rail transportation; lighting, communication systems in all kinds  of sectors and areas that come to mind electric energy is used. Research has shown that a well-designed,  conserved or integrated electrical power grid can minimize any interruptions or malfunctions that  interfere with the functioning of human life. The rapid increase in electricity demand, depletion of fossil  energy sources, developments in power electronics technologies and the use of renewable energy  sources for energy production, the use of distributed generation constituted the concept of smart grids  [1], [2].   Smart grid is reduced due to the losses occurring in transmission lines and increase efficiency in  this case. The increase in the concept of energy efficiency in recent years has increased the importance  of the studies on smart grids. In addition, with the help of smart grid models, the negative effects that  deteriorate the power quality of the industrial facilities are eliminated and power losses in the  transmission lines are reduced. Thus, more efficient and reliable networks can be created. Smart grids  have many advantages [3], [4]. Some of these advantages are presented in the table 1 [5].                        Table 1.

In smart grid applications there are some disadvantageous situations. The factors such as technical  difficulties in integration into the existing network, new standards, administrative and legal barriers can  be considered as disadvantages of smart grids. The figure 1 [6] shows the various functions involved in  smart grid automation.     A. Nur, A. Kaygusuz, U.

Smart grid automation functions [6].      2. AC/DC Hybrid Systems   Many models have been developed on smart grid structure and each designed system has brought  a different definition to this structure. Although there are different definitions, all developed smart  networks have three main components. These; power supplies, loads and storage devices [7].   2.1 Power Supplies   Hybrid smart grid power generation system is the systems that produce energy from at least two  or more raw energy sources in practice and units that contribute to each other in parallel. These systems  are generally safer and less costly than a single source of energy production. The aim of hybrid systems  is to increase the efficiency by enabling the use of energy resources together. In addition, if one of the  resources is absent or diminished, the others are able to meet the energy needs of the system. The most  important factors that determine the number of resources and the type of resources in such applications  are the sufficient level of resources in the region where energy will be produced and sufficient  technology to bring the system together in some types of energy [8].   Generation sources such as generators, wind turbines, photovoltaic modules that form hybrid  networks supply AC or DC loads with suitable converters. The introduction of these power electronics  converters affects both the power quality of the system and requires new control arrangements.           105                                                                                                              A. Nur, A. Kaygusuz, U. Kılıç     ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 11 (2019) 102-110   2.2 Loads   In smart grid applications, loads can be applied in a variety of areas, residential, commercial and  industrial. In general, commercial and industrial users require high power quality and reliability for  critical and precise load demands. Smart grids can consist of hybrid systems consisting of DC-connected  loads, AC-connected loads and both DC and AC-connected loads. In the DC connected system topology,  as shown in figure 2 [11] , all generators and storage units are connected to the DC bus. If there are  power supplies with AC output, they are first converted to DC. All added DC power supplies are then  connected to AC user loads by inverters with a DC/AC converter in the base DC power bus. These  inverters convert DC power produced in different generators and storage units into AC user load  demands at the desired voltage and frequency. The inverter to be used must be sufficient for peak load  demands [9], [10].                                    Figure 2. Structure of the DC Grid [11].      In the AC Connected system topology, as shown in figure 3 [11], all system components and AC  user loads are connected to the AC bus. AC-connected system topology outperforms DC-connected  system topology. Each inverter can be synchronized to its own generator so that it can supply power  independently or simultaneously with the other inverter. This provides flexibility for energy sources to  meet load demand [12].   AC/DC hybrid systems consist of AC and DC sources and loads as shown in figure 4 [11]. It can  be connected to the mains power supply or operated independently. In grid-connected or grid- independent hybrid system applications, battery technologies and energy storage systems are also used  to increase continuity in power generation [13].     A. Nur, A.

Storage Devices   Energy storage technologies used in smart grids; It is an important area of interest for electricity  generation and distribution companies, plant operators and electric vehicle manufacturers. The ability  to store large amounts of energy can provide great flexibility for the operations of electricity companies.  In this way, the demanded energy does not have to be produced at the same time. Solutions for power  quality problems such as the development of energy storage technologies, voltage drop and interruptions  are provided at both system and equipment level. However, energy storage; system efficiency, enabling  the integration of renewable energy sources, increasing network stability and reliability, as well as  reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although direct storage of electrical energy is expensive, it can be  stored in different forms for conversion to electrical energy when needed. The main energy storage units  used in smart grids are; flywheels, super capacitors, superconducting magnetic energy storage and  electrochemical cells [14]. The figure 5 shows the most important storage technologies for the smart  grids [15].                      Figure 5. Storage technologies for the smart grids [15].        3. Case Study    The base values for the per-unit conversion in this system are Sbase=1 MVA, Vacbase=12.66 kV,  and Vdcbase=6.8 kV. The effciency and the power factor of the VSCs are given as 98% and 95 %.  Figure 6 [16] shows the DC grid system and the impedances of this system [16] is shown in table 2.

The development of AC/DC hybrid systems in smart grid is rapidly progressing  and various analyzes are performed for AC/DC hybrid power flow analysis. The main information  obtained from the power flow analysis studies are the amplitude of the voltage, phase angle, active and  reactive powers for each bus. Analyzing these values is very important for the planning and development  of power systems.   In this study, in the literature standard IEEE 33 bus test system is modified by adding a DC grid  system. Then, this model is analyzed by Newton-Raphson method in Matlab environment and after that  power values are obtained for each bus as shown in table 3 and table 4. The results are showed that the  proposed method can be used in the analysis of power systems. Furthermore, this study provides  guidance for future AC/DC hybrid power system analysis studies.

To determine the share of these  costs within the mining investment amounts, surveys were carried out through the ""Survey Monkey"" survey  program for mining enterprises. In the answers to these questions, the cost of the pasture lands is calculated as  the ratio of each mining enterprise to its investment amounts. The average of all fees paid by the mining  enterprises for the pasture lands to a total of pre-2018 and new mining investment amounts after 2018 is 0.44%  for all mineral groups.

To determine the share of these  costs within the mining investment amounts, surveys were carried out through the ""Survey Monkey"" survey  program for mining enterprises. In the answers to these questions, the cost of the pasture lands is calculated as  the ratio of each mining enterprise to its investment amounts. The average of all fees paid by the mining  enterprises for the pasture lands to a total of pre-2018 and new mining investment amounts after 2018 is 0.44%  for all mineral groups. These numbers show that pasture costs taken once from mining enterprises in Turkey  have a significant share in total investment amounts.

Introduction   It is an indisputable fact that the development of the national industries should be accelerated by  developing mining, by using the resources available in the best way that they are not left idle and by  the production of resources through identifying unknown resources to ensure the development of  countries in the world.   There is no chance to choose a place in mining because the mines must be produced where they  are located. The fact that the mines have to be produced where they are located brings along other  benefits and field usage conflicts. Indeed, one of the most common ones is pasture lands. Pasture  lands constitute 18.6% of the 78,534,470 million hectares, which are the total surface of Turkey  (Figure 1).        Figure 1. The proportion of land use classes to the total surface of Turkey   The immovable properties in Turkey can be divided into two main categories: Immovable  property subject to private ownership and immovable properties under the public ownership of the  state [1]. In administrative law, the state-owned immovable properties are classified into three groups:  ownerless properties (including pasture lands), common properties and service properties†.   The allocation of service properties to mining is almost impossible. However, the state-owned  immovable properties in terms of mining law are common properties such as wastelands and pastures  [1]. In Turkey, it is possible to allocate the qualified common property among the immovable property  necessary for the operation of natural resources and energy investments if required by the licensee [2].    Pasture lands are the places where animals are assigned to the village or town residents to take  advantage of grazing their animals and using the land’s grass. These lands have been used with this  orientation since the past. Essentially, for the acceptance of a place as pasture, it must be entered in  the register of common properties, which is a separate register from the land registry.                                                         † • Ownerless Properties"": These are the properties suitable for establishing ownership. However, the ownership has not been established on  them so far. Examples of such properties that are not under private ownership include rocks, mountains, hills, coasts, and forests.   • It is stated that the properties, which are called ""common properties"" in Turkish law, consist of goods which are allocated to the direct use  of the people. Examples of such properties include roads, bridges, squares, marketplaces, highlands, and pasture lands.  • ""Service properties"" are the properties of public legal entities and allocated to public service. They are reserved for indirect use of the  public. Examples of such properties include ports, military facilities, railways, hospitals, universities, mosques, and courthouses [1].      25                                                                                                                                      T. Deniz YILDIZ     ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 10 (2019) 23-31   In other words, unless the nature of the pasture changes, it cannot be subject to private  ownership, and due to the timeout, ownership cannot be acquired [3]. Also, pastures, highlands and  winter quarters have the same legal value as the registered pasture for non-agricultural use and these  areas refer to the lands used for grazing. In Article 4 of the Pasture Law No. 4342, it is envisaged that  the provisions of the Pasture Law will be applied to these.      According to the Pasture Law, mining activities in pasture lands are subject to many conditions.  According to Article 14 of this Law amended by Law No. 4368, in pasture lands, mining exploration  activities, and efficient mining operation activities can be performed [4]. To register the area whose  allocation purpose was changed in the name of the state treasury, the licensee is required to give the  Environmental Impact Assessment Positive document before starting the operation. Hence, it is  mandatory that the damaged lands due to mining operation activities should be harmonized with the  environment when the activity is finished. In this respect, necessary arrangements were made in the  Mining Law. The duration of a mining operation is limited to the period envisaged in the Mining Law  No. 3213. It should be noted that where the purpose of pasture allocation is changed, vegetation  generally shows a weak feature. For example, in a gypsum field, it is clear that when gypsum is  removed and replaced with fertile ground cover, the pasture will be much more useful than its former  condition. In the Regulation on Pasture – similar to mining legislation- for harmonization with the  environment, it is envisaged that the licensee will make a down payment to be determined by the  commission in order to make the areas damaged by them unchanged. Otherwise, the commission will  use this payment to fulfill this task and all costs incurred together with the loss of the value of the  grass is regulated in Article 8th of Regulation on Pasture [5] and [6].   There may be adverse decisions regarding the change of the pasture allocation and the decisions  taken to prevent mining operations. In some regions where these decisions are made, when we look at  the operating project incomes of the mines to be produced, it is seen that the livestock activities that  will benefit from the pasture have a value above the contribution to the country's economy. In such  cases, it is not understood that the change in allocation purpose is not appropriate. Once an  unfavorable decision is made on the allocation of pastures, then similar decisions are made in this  regard, and the pasture areas are closed to mining. This time, it is ignored that the purpose of  allocation of the pasture is to be done temporarily and these lands remain as pastures. In other words,  it is not possible to shrink the pasture lands as a result of mining activities [6]. As shown above,  pasture lands constitute 18.6% of the total surface of Turkey, which means that these lands also have  alternative areas. However, it is necessary to give importance to scientific criteria in determining  which is a superior public interest compared to the mines which are limited and which are mandatory  on-site production and this should be determined by legislation.   A brief review of mining operation activities in pasture lands has been made, especially in  terms of competent authorities and legislation. To perform mining operation activities in pasture  lands, mining investors pay some costs such as land and grass loss expenses for once only. In this  respect, a survey was carried out through the ""Survey Monkey"" Survey Program for mining enterprises  in May, June and July 2018 to determine the amount of these costs in the investment amounts of  mining enterprises‡.   In this study, based on the answers that the mining enterprises gave, the change of the costs  required to perform mining operation activities in pasture lands in Turkey according to the different  mineral groups was examined. At the same time, the ratio of these costs to the investment of mining  enterprises were analyzed in terms of their differences according to the mineral groups.   2. Costs Paid By Mining Enterprises for Pasture Lands & Their Share in Investment Amounts                                                          ‡. The survey questions were answered by the relevant departments of the mining companies. The answers were transferred collectively to  the survey program, regardless of which companies answered the survey and what responses were given to the questions.         T. Deniz YILDIZ                                                                                                                                  26     ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 10 (2019) 23-31   In the world, past mining experiences highlighted the interdependent relationship between  commercial and economic benefits and the legal change in environmental impact. When determining  where to put the right balance, attention should be paid to the negative consequences of the  environment on the environment, to ensure the sustainable management of natural resources by  creating an optimum balance [7].   Investors in mining face both technical and non-technical risks. Risks in the non-technical  category are land access laws, land claims, bureaucracy, environmental risks, social risks, and  infrastructure risk. Such risks cannot be separated entirely from the technical risks in any  comprehensive risk classification system applied to the mining sector; they inevitably overlap.  Environmental risks, for example, include technical aspects of the design and engineering of the mine,  infrastructure, and waste facilities, as well as non-technical risks related to government regulations and  permits [8].   Governments can improve the prospect of investment in the mining sector by establishing  regulatory structures that guarantee ""investment and license security"" by taking necessary steps to  meet investors' decision-making criteria [9]. If the state cannot direct sufficient capital and technology  for mining activities, then it is essential to apply market-friendly policies to attract private investors  and firms that can provide them [10].   On the other hand, the limited availability of resources in a country requires that these should be  used in an efficient and maximum way without wastefulness. Because investment projects (such as  raw materials, capital, labor etc.) are the plans for the optimum utilization of limited economic  resources in a way to maximize their benefits. Investment is a strategic decision that is of utmost  importance for the companies. The investment project, which is one of the most important means of  economic development, to reach the projected targets (minimum time, minimum cost, minimum  capacity) in the project [11], should not be out of expectations due to the legislation.   Thus, in terms of expenditures and risks, the most crucial activity group related to mining in  pre-production activities [12]. These activities include mining operations permit process.   Considering this explanation in case of overlapping of mining activities with pastures in  Turkey, it is useful to determine how much the related permitting process costs have taken in mining  investments. In this respect, first of all, the pasture costs should be shown according to different  mineral groups.   2.1 Paid Costs for Pasture Lands   The mining enterprises were asked: “How much is the amount (TL§) you pay (if paid) for the  pasture lands (land and grass loss expenses etc.)?” Forty-two mining enterprises answered to this  question. The ratio of these answers according to different mineral groups** is shown below (Figure  2).                                                          § 1 USD Dollar = 4.84 Turkish Lira (16th July 2018) [13]  ** According to the Mining Law number 3213, minerals shall be licensed in accordance with the group listed below:  Ist Group Minerals  a) Sand and Gravel which are used in construction and road building and that are naturally present in nature.  b) Brick-Tile clay, Cement clay, Marn, Pozzolanic rock (Trass) and the rocks that are used in cement and ceramics industries and not include  in other groups.

Change between the pasture costs and mineral groups    As can be seen from the figure above, any change relationship and the degree of significance  among the average values of the pasture costs for different mineral groups cannot be mentioned. The  correlation coefficient is R2 = 0.17. It should be noted that other factors are affecting the increase in  pasture costs. The reason why the correlation coefficient is too low in this increase is that the amount  of pasture land that overlaps with the mining areas is variable for different mineral groups (In fact, it  is not known how many hectares of pasture lands overlap with the mining enterprises that respond to  the survey).    Thus, it is useful to determine how much these pasture land using costs are paid by each  enterprise in their mine investment amounts and average annual operating costs to perform mining  activities.    2.2. The ratio of the pasture costs to the total investment amounts   For calculating the rate of pasture costs to mining investment amounts, the mining enterprises  were asked: “How much is the investment amount (TL) of your mining enterprises (by the end of  2017)?” All mining enterprises are shown in Figure 2, 42 mining enterprises, answered to this  question. These answers, according to different mineral groups, as shown below (Figure 4).         Figure 4. The investment amounts of mining enterprises until the end of 2017‡‡                                                          ‡‡ “>500 Million TL”: was accepted as 500 million- 1 billion, namely 750 million TL on average.   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  Group 2 (a) Group 2 (b) Group 4 (a) Group 4 (b) Group 4 (c)  Th e   nu m  be r   of  m  in in  g  en  te rp  ri se  s  Investment amounts of mining enterprises until the end of 2017  (TL)  0  - 500 thousand 500 thousand - 1 million 1 - 5 million 5 - 10 million 10 - 20 million 20-50 million 50-100 million 100-250 million 250-500 million    29                                                                                                                                      T. Deniz YILDIZ     ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 10 (2019) 23-31   The ratio of these investment amounts shows that the mining enterprises in Turkey are mostly in  the small and medium-sized business group. This indicates that the pasture costs required from the  mining enterprises will have a more significant impact on those enterprises.    For perform mining activities in pasture lands, all costs to be paid (land and grass loss  expenses) are given only once at the start of the mining operation. Thus, considering this situation, the  amounts paid for the pasture lands by each mining enterprise that is individually responding to the  survey were proportioned to the total investment amounts before 2018.   However, these mining enterprises are planning to make new investments in 2018 and the  following years. In this respect, mining enterprises were asked: “How much (TL) is the new investment  amount aimed in your mining enterprises in 2018 and the following years?"" The answers of 42 mining  enterprises are shown below according to different mineral groups (Figure 5).        Figure 5. New investment amounts aimed by mine enterprises in 2018 and the following years    The total investment amounts paid by mining enterprises are obtained through the collection of  the investment amounts in 2018 and the following years (aimed) and before 2018 (current). The ratio  of the pasture costs paid by the mining enterprises to the total investment amounts paid by those  enterprises during their entire lifetime is shown below (on a weighted average) (Table 1).

This percentage shows that the pasture costs required from the  mining enterprises have a significant share in the current and aimed investment amounts by itself. The  ratio of the pasture costs to the total investment amounts and mineral groups are shown below (Figure  6).        Figure 6. Mineral groups & the ratio of the pasture costs and to the total investment amounts   As it is seen in the figure, the relationship between these proportions shows a polynomial  change as the correlation coefficient. Then the correlation coefficient is R2 = 0.887. Based on this data,  there is a reasonable degree of significance between this variable relationship.   It is remarkable that the share of the pasture costs in the total mining investment amounts is  quite high in the 2nd Mineral Group compared to other groups. This situation shows that the mining  enterprises in the 2nd Mineral Group will have great difficulty in paying the pasture costs since their  investment amounts are low compared to other enterprises in the 4th Mineral Group.   3. Conclusion and Suggestions                                                          §§ Of the 42 mining enterprises that gave information about the amounts of the mining investment and the  pasture costs they paid, 21 of the mining enterprises which stated that they paid the pasture price between “0- 10000 TL” were excluded from this calculation. In particular, this situation was preferred by considering that the  mining enterprises may not have paid the pasture cost, but could have mistakenly selected the “0-10000 TL”  pasture cost option in the survey question. Thus, as the average of mineral groups, it is aimed to calculate the  share of pasture costs more consistently within the investment amounts of mining enterprises.     31                                                                                                                                      T. Deniz YILDIZ     ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 10 (2019) 23-31   The delays in the pasture land using permits to be taken to perform mining activities in case of  overlapping with pasture lands are reflected the mining enterprises in our country as a cost. Also, the  required costs are added for the pasture lands.   The ratio of these investment amounts shows that the mining enterprises in Turkey are mostly in  the small and medium-sized business group. This indicates that the pasture costs required from the  mining enterprises will have a more significant impact on those enterprises.    As discussed, the results show that pasture costs have a significant share. Notably, the  mentioned pasture costs are quite compeller cost item for the mining enterprises in 2nd Mineral Group  economically since their investments are lower than the other enterprises. Thus, lowering the pasture  costs to a more reasonable level with legislation will be a positive development for the mining sector.    Pasture lands constitute 18.6% of the total surface of Turkey, which means that these lands also  have alternative areas. However, it is necessary to give importance to scientific criteria in determining  which is a superior public interest compared to the mines which are limited and which are mandatory  on-site production and this should be determined by legislation.

AYAZ, A. BUDAK   ADYU Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi 10 (2019) 32-46   1. Introduction     Many studies analyze frames with the matrix method [1-12]. After the use of computers  become common, matrix methods became more popular. The addition of the shear effect to the matrix  method is also very common and is well established [7,12]. Despite its large effect, the wide support  effect is generally neglected. In the solution of bar elements, the bar length is considered to be the  length between nodes. This length does not represent the bar length exactly in frames. The intersection  of the column and the beam is different from both the column and the beam. This part is called the  wide support or the rigid end zone. In frames, the bar length does not start from the node points. A bar  length started from the node points causes inaccuracy in the results. Increasing the bar height increases  the common component, and this causes unacceptable errors in the results.      In the stiffness method main problem is to obtain stiffness matrix. After the construction of the  stiffness matrix the problem is solved systematically. In previous studies only one effect is handled in  the stiffness matrix. In this study, the stiffness matrix including both the shear and wide support effects  was developed and explicit formulations for stiffness members are given. By using this formulation, it  is possible to obtain stiffness matrix for normal solution, shear effect, wide support effect and their  combinations (bare solution, only shear effect, only wide support effect and both shear and wide  support effects).  The results obtained from proposed method were also verified experimentally. For  this purpose, a frame was solved for with the proposed method. For experimental verification, the  same frame was tested, and the maximum deflection value was obtained. A finite element method  (FEM) model for this frame was created. The results of three methods are compared. Two different  frames were solved for with the proposed methods, and the results are compared with the FEM results.  The results of the proposed method were consistent with the FEM results. In the case of the cantilever  beam, where only the shear effect is present, the proposed method also has been proven theoretically.  In the frame example, the results of the proposed method and FEM results and experimental results  were consistent.   2. Theoretical    2.1.

The shear effect is neglected in most mechanical problems because of its small value.  Generally, the decision to neglect the shear effect is made according to the length / height ratio (L/h)  of the members. Shear effect increases with increases in the height and decreases in the L/h ratio. The  shear effect should be considered if the L/h ratio is less than 10 [7,13].        Figure 1. Consideration of the shear effect [7].      To include the shear effect in the stiffness members, moment Ai and vertical force Ci are applied  to the beam in Fig. 1. The coefficients of the moments that cause unit rotation in node i produce the Ai  and Bij stiffness coefficients. θA ' and θA '' represent the absolute value of rotation, and dA' and dA''  represent the absolute value of displacement caused by the Ai moment and the Ci vertical force applied  to node i and θA and dA represent rotation and deflection at point A respectively.

As can be seen in Fig. 2, the values of λi, λj and ε approach 1 as the L/h  ratio increases to 10.     2.2. Wide Support Condition    The wide support effect has a greater effect than the shear effect in most conditions. On the  contrary, however, in most studies the shear effect is considered while the wide support effect is  neglected. In classical beam theory when a frame member is solved in one dimension, such as is done  for a bar element, the member length is selected between two nodes. In fact, the intersection of the  column and beam is different from the column and the beam. This segment cannot be considered in  the beam or the column length. To consider the intersection of the column and the beam as part of the  column or as part of the beam introduces a large error into the solution. The size of this common  segment grows as the member height increases, and this increases the error in the result. This segment  that must be treated differently from the beam and the column is called the wide support or the rigid  end zone. For a wide support, the stiffness matrix and the fixed end forces change and have to be  regenerated. Tezcan solved this problem with rigid rotation of this part[7].             Figure 3. Wide support in a frame.       As seen in Fig. 3, first, the common segment in the beam-column is assumed to be totally rigid.  By adding additional deformation caused by rigid rotation of this block, the stiffness members for the  wide support condition are calculated. e1 and e2 represent the half-length of nodes i and j, respectively.  The {d'} deformation on the nodes of the free beam length (i'-j') can be written with the help of the {d}  deformation on nodes of theoretical length [7],      { } [ ]{ }dTd =' .                      (15)     By means of rigid rotation of the column-beam intersection segment, the deformation relations  between the real length and the theoretical length of the beam can be derived.

Shear effect on wide support conditions   In the previous sections, the shear effect and the wide support effect are investigated  individually. When the height of the member increases, both the wide support and the shear effects  increase. Therefore, both effects must be considered simultaneously. A stiffness matrix needs to be  developed to consider both effects.     The stiffness members for the shear effect in uniform cross-section members are     ii L EI  A λ4=           jj L EI  A λ4=    ijij L EI  B λ2=                L CC  D L  BA C  L BA  C jijj i  i +  = +  = +  = ,, .          Taking both the shear and wide support effects of equation (31) into account, the free length L0  is used to obtain the stiffness matrix. Therefore, the stiffness members are obtained as follows:      ii L EI  A λ 0  4'=    jj L EI  A λ 0  4'=    ijij L EI  B λ 0  2'=    000  '' '  '' ',  '' '  L CC  Dand　n L  BA C  L BA  C jijj i  i  + =  + =  + =                    The stiffness matrix [ ]'k for the free length is given in equation (22), and the transformation  matrix [T] for displacement in the wide support condition is given in equation (19). The stiffness  matrix for theoretical nodes [k] is given in equation (21) and is [k]=[T]T [k'] [T].

Experimental   To verify the results provided by the proposed method and by FEM and to observe the exact  behavior of the models, experimental test was carried out. An experimental model frame was produced  from S220 steel. Specimens were produced from used material, and the modulus of elasticity was  determined. The modulus of elasticity (E) for model 1 was calculated, with the help of the tensile test,  to be 202,016.99 MPa. The Poisson ratio was taken as 0.3.    The experimental model was fabricated to give measurable results and to have a wide support  effect (Fig. 6). A dial gauge was used to observe movement and rotation on the support. The loads  were selected as the maximum of the elastic limit and the buckling load. The tests were repeated 10  times for model 1 and the averages of the results were used.                                      Y. AYAZ, A.

Finite Element Modeling     In this study, a 2-D, eight-node element PLANE82, which provides more accurate results and  can tolerate irregular shapes, is used. The PLANE82 geometry and stress output are shown in Figs. 7  and 8.        Figure 7. PLANE82 geometry (2-D, eight-node structural solid)[14].        Figure 8. PLANE82 stress output[14].      PLANE82 is a higher-order version of the 2-D, four-node element PLANE42. The eight-node  elements have compatible displacement shapes and are well suited to model curved boundaries. The  eight-node element is defined by eight nodes having two degrees of freedom at each node: translations  in the nodal x and y directions. The element may be used as a plane element or as an axisymmetric  element. The element has plasticity, creep, swelling, stress stiffening, large deflection and large strain  capabilities [14].     5.

Bar solution and FEM solution give nearly same result if shear effect is considered in bar  solution. Even in example 4 where L/h is very small as 1.7, BAR solution give good result if shear  effect is considered.

In example 5 differences in between FEM and BAR results is 12.64%  without shear effect in bar solution. But addition of shear effect increase difference to 16.73%.  Therefore, in frames wide support effect should be considered to eliminate this difference.      5.2. Experimental Results   The experimental deflection of point B (EXP) of Model 1, shown in Fig. 6, is given in Table 4  and compared with the deflection of point B obtained with the normal bar solution (BAR), the bar  solution including only the shear effect (BAR+S), the bar solution including only the wide support  effect (BAR+W), the bar solution including both the shear and wide support effects (BAR+S+W) and  the finite element method (FEM) solution.    It can be seen from Table 4 that the experimental result is within 1% of the proposed method  solution (BAR+S+W), which includes both the shear and wide support effects.       Table 4.

The proposed method gives good result.    Shear has 0.27% effect and wide support effect has 7.96% effect in theoretical solution. Wide  support effect is bigger than shear effect (Table 5).   It is known that to get more accurate result shear effect should be considered. But as seen in  Table 4 and Table 6 shear effect has adverse effect in frames if frame members are solved as bar.  Without shear effect BAR result is 7.78% different than EXPERIMENT result. Adding shear effect  increase difference to 8.06%.    When the results given in the tables are examined, it can be seen that the proposed method  results are closer to the FEM results than are the other methods.     6. Conclusions   Frame models were tested experimentally, and the proposed method, which includes both the  shear and wide support effects, was verified successfully. The wide support was observed to have a  more substantial effect than the shear effect. Addition of shear effect is known to lead a more accurate  solution. In contrast to frames, this result is correct if only one member is handled. Results of FEM  solution and bar solution with shear effect overlapped for one member structures such as cantilever  beam. In frames, the model results are closer to the FEM and experimental results when the shear  effect is neglected. The shear effect caused the model results to deviate from the experimental and  FEM results. The results of the proposed method, in which both the shear and wide support effects are  included, were shown to be closer to the experimental and FEM results than the other methods were.    In practice, the wide support rigid length e was observed to change from h/2 to h/4 in most  problems. Accordingly e can be selected between the h/2 and h/4 intervals.                             Y.

This cross-sectional study was conducted in a vocational higher  education school (N=3886 students). Single stage systematic random sampling technique was  used to select the participants from the population and data of the study was collected by face to  face interviews. We interviewed 661 students. The mean age of the students was 20.1±2.3 years  and 68.2% were male. It was found that 15.9% of participants had an experience in any type of  fire, also 21.2% of the students had a training about fire. Although 85.8% stated that they were  keeping children away from flammable materials, only 19.7% had a fire action plan to escape in  their living places where they lived in. Students living in the dormitory (OR: 1.63), who had any  education on fire (OR: 1.46), and who received first aid training (OR: 1.37) had more positive fire- related behavior. To reduce the risk of mortality, morbidity and economic burden of fires in  countries and increase the level of readiness to fire where prevention and intervention services  are limited, trainings on fire prevention, early intervention skills and basic first aid training for  fires are needed among young people. Higher education period is appropriate for those trainings.

INTRODUCTION    Residential fires are one of the most common disasters and important cause of accidental death  in the world and in developing countries. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)  reported that average number of residential fires were 358 500 per year during 2011-2015 in  USA. These fires caused an average of 2 510 deaths, 12 300 injuries, and approximately 6.7 Billion  Dollars indirect property lose per year (Ahrens, 2017). A study conducted in United Arab  Emirates, found that 5 490 fire incidents occured between the periods of 2006–2013. Residential  fires were responsible of about 28% of all fires (Alqassim and Daeid, 2014). Another study from  Jordan found that annual average of fires was 8 198 between 2000-2004 period, and residential  fires were account of 20% of all fires. The authors stated that the fire frequency was increasing  sharply over the period of 1999–2004 (Sweis, 2006). A comprehensive study conducted in Turkey  revealed that one million fire cases lived between 1988 and 2008. It has also been observed that  there has been a significant increase in fire numbers over the years, and fire numbers increased  from 20 000 in 1998 to 90 000 in 2008 (Bekem, Cavus, Demirel, 2011).   The residential fires are responsible of majority and severe form of fatal burn injuries (Mallonee  et al., 1996). Injuries and deaths resulting from residential fires are an important public health  problem especially in developing countries because of limited preventive interventions and  rescue services (Jonsson et al., 2017). In low and middle-income countries death rate was eleven  times higher than in high-income countries death rate (Peden, 2008), and over 90% of fatal fire- related burns occur in developing countries (Murray et al., 1996). According to WHO statistics,  310 000 people died as a result of fire related burns every year, of whom 96 000 were under the  age of 20 (Murray et al., 1996). Based on the Characteristics of Home Fire Victims Survey, children  under the age of five were one and a half times as likely as the general population to die in a home  fire. Youth are also at the greatest risk of death in fire at home structure (Hall, 2005). Furthermore,  the report indicated that people ages 20-49 faced the highest risk of non-fatal injury from home  fires. Also, injury risk for adults between the ages of 20 and 34 was 30 percent higher than the  average person (Hall, 2005).   To prevent residential fires and reduce fire related deaths and injuries; besides technological  interventions such as smoke alarms, sprinklers, child resistant lighters and fire safe cigarettes, it  is important to focus on understanding and changing negative human behaviors which are  responsible of fires (Warda and Ballesteros, 2008). Negative human behaviors can include a wide  variety of behavioral and psychological factors and these behaviors contributes to fire setting     Afet ve Risk Dergisi Cilt: 3 Sayı: 2, 2020 (159-168)          Ebru İNAL, Edip KAYA,   Baki Can METİN, Nüket PAKSOY ERBAYDAR   161     behavior (Bowling, Merrick and Omar, 2013). Also, it is known that using technological material  like smoke alarms and sprinkler was very low in Turkey and in other developing countries  because of unawareness of the effectiveness of these practices among people (Forjuoh, 2006). In  developing countries, personal behavior is critical as fire prevention services are not satisfactory.  Since Turkey is a developing country, people’s behaviors gain importance towards fire prevention  services. Young people should be in the target groups who can gain positive behaviors related to  fire due to their dynamic structure and being open to change.   Few published studies evaluated the behaviors of people related to residential fires. According to  Second Injury Control and Risk Survey (ICARIS-2) 52% of household reported had a fire escape  plan and only 16% of them with an escape plan reported practicing it every six months in USA  (Ballesteros, Kresnow, 2007). In Sweden, Ploubidis and colleagues measured self-reported  behaviors which may form elements of a plan for escaping from a house fire. According to the  study, 32% of participants reported having a torch next to the bed, 79% reported having kept  their escape routes visible, 86% recorded having external door keys, 36% strongly agreed or  agreed that, in the case of a fire, their child could be hiding under the bed and 35% might be hiding  in a cupboard or wardrobe (Ploubidis et al., 2015). Keeping children from flammable materials  (lighters, matches, etc.) is also an important behavior for preventing fires. Playing of children with  flammable materials (lighters, matches, etc.) is responsible for approximately 5% of residential  fires, but those fires are related to a greater proportion of deaths. A study conducted in Dallas,  USA show that fire play accounts for around 42% of deaths of children in residental fire (Istre et  al., 2002).   Positive behaviors such as having a fire action plan to escape, keeping children away from  flammable materials, saving emergency numbers in the phonebook, not doing electrical repairs  by themselves, leaving the keys on the entrance door play an important role for prevent  residential fires and death and injuries related it. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the  behaviors which are effective to prevent residential fires and associated factors among young  adults.      2. METHOD   2.1. Study Design and Setting   After the ethical approval, which was obtained by the institutional review board, this cross- sectional study was conducted in Yalova Vocational School. The school is an associate degree and  offer education in a wide range of fields such as textile technology, electric and energy, marketing  and advertising and computer technology. There were 3,886 students in the school at the 2017- 2018 academic year (Yalova University).   2.2. Participants    The inclusion criteria of the study was being a student at the school at the 2017-2018 academic  year. The exclusion criteria was attending to the Civil Defense and Firefighting Program (CDFP)  because of having formal education on nature, causes, prevention and intervention on fires. Of the  students, 80 were excluded to because of attending to the CDFP.   2.3. Data and Variables   Data was gathered with a 14-question survey by face to face interview with participants between  01 and 10 May 2018. Five interviewers who were trained had the interviews. On the  questionnaire, four questions were about sociodemographic characteristics; three were about the  experiences, and seven were about the behaviors of the students on residential fires. Age was  categorized to two groups (19 years and younger and 20 years and older) for comparing the     Are Sociodemographic Characteristics and Experiences Associated to Behaviours on Residential Fires?   A Young Adult Sample   162     behavioral scores. The behaviors of the participants on fires were evaluated through seven items  which could be answered as “yes” or “no”. According to the behavioral scoring system the  maximum score was 16 points (Having an emergency assembly point outside the living place in  case of fire took one point, having a fire action plan, saving emergency numbers in the phonebook  and leaving the keys on the entrance door took two point, and keeping children away from  flammable materials, not doing electrical repairs by themselves and not using more than one  multiple adapter in power outlets took three points).   2.4. Sample Size   For the population of 3 806 students, minimum required sample size was calculated as 650 with  an effect size of (d) 0.2, an α of 0.05, and a power of 0.80, using G Power version 3.1.9.2. Finally,  the target sample size was identified as 715 by increasing the minimum required sample size by  10%, considering possible refusals. Single stage systematic random sampling technique was used  to select the participants from the population.   2.5. Statistical Analysis   Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows version 23. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test  was used for evaluating the distribution of continuous data. Descriptive statistics were shown as  mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed data, median with interquartile range  (IQR) for quantitative discrete data, and frequency (n) and percentage (%) for categorical  variables. Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for univariate analyses of  behavioral score according to the characteristics of the participants. Dunn’s test with Bonferroni  correction was used for posthoc pairwise comparisons of the participants’ living places.  Multivariate ordinal regression was used to examine the association of the characteristics of the  participants with behavioral score of the participants. In univariate analyzes were included all  independent variables with p<0.20 in the multivariate model and p<0.05 was defined as  statistically significance level.       3. RESULTS   Of the 715 students, 23 students could not be reached, and 31 students refused to participate. We  interviewed with 661 students who accepted to participate in the study. All the questions asked  in the questionnaire were answered completely by the participants. The mean age of the students  was 20.1±2.3 years and 68.2% (CI: 64.9%-71.3%) were male. Of the 661 participants, 45.7% (CI:  42.3%-49.2%) were living in a dorm, 29.7% (CI: 26.6%-32.9%) in a house without family and  24.6% (CI: 21.8%-27.8%) were living with their family. Only 20.7% (CI: 18.1%-23.7%) of them  were the owner of their residence (Table 1).    Of the participants, 15.9% (CI: 13.6%-18.6%) had an experience in any type of fire, and 21.2%  (18.6%-24.2%) had a training on any topic of fire. On the other hand, nearly half of them (46.9%,  CI: 43.5%-50.4%) had a basic first aid knowledge (Table 2). The mean total behavioral score was  8.17 with a standard deviation of 2.87 (not shown in the table).   The behaviors of the students about the residential fires were found different levels. Although  19.7% (CI: 17.1%-22.6%) of the participants had a fire action plan to escape in their living places,  85.8% (CI: 83.2%-88.0%) stated that they were keeping children away from flammable materials.  Of the students, 21.6% (CI: 19.0%-24.7%) reported that they had an emergency assembly point  outside the living place in case of fire; 27.1% (CI: 24.1%-30.3%) saved emergency numbers in the  phonebook (to remember in case of panic); 79.9% (CI: 76.9%-82.5%) did not do electrical repairs  by themselves; 36.8% (CI: 33.5%-40.2%) did not use more than one multiple adapter in power  outlets; and 47.2% (43.8%-50.7%) left the keys on the entrance door (Table 3).

There was no significant association between the behavioral scores  of participants and age, sex, ownership of residence or having experience in any type of fire. (Table  4). In the multivariate analysis, we found that the behavioral score of students was significantly     Are Sociodemographic Characteristics and Experiences Associated to Behaviours on Residential Fires?

Students living in the dormitory (OR: 1.63), who had any education on fire (OR: 1.46), and who  received first aid training (OR: 1.37) were more positive fire-related behavior (Table 4).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION   Burn injuries related to fires continue to be one of the main causes of unintentional death and  injury (Peden, 2008). For fires, Global Burden of Disease 2017 recorded heat, hot substance and  fire injuries in 360 000 (313 000–380 000). Furthermore, WHO had similar estimates as 410 000  burn injuries (Spencer et al., 2018). Furthermore, fire-related burns in low- and middle-income  countries were among the leading causes of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) (Peden, 2008).   A variety of risk factors were reported for the fatal residential fires (Doll et al., 2007). These  include employment, grade education, rural residence, disability of physical and mental, male  gender, and home-related factors such as home ownership and form of housing (Warda,  Tenenbein and Moffatt, 1999). However, behavioural factors of residential fire injury and its  prevention were not well documented in current literature on the research (Warda, Tenenbein  and Moffatt, 1999). These behaviours include daily practices, such as safe cooking behaviours and  location of space heaters, principles of applied behavioural analysis, modelling of evacuation,  factors influencing fire risk perception, visual exposure, and concepts of residential design (Doll  et al., 2007). A collection of main factors for predicting and explaining behavioural changes  affecting many health issues have been identified, including three variables deemed appropriate  and adequate intentions, environmental barriers and skills and five variables that can affect the  intensity and direction of intentions or directly affect behavioral expectations, social norms, self- standards (Fishbein et al., 2001).      Afet ve Risk Dergisi Cilt: 3 Sayı: 2, 2020 (159-168)          Ebru İNAL, Edip KAYA,   Baki Can METİN, Nüket PAKSOY ERBAYDAR   165     Behaviours as having a fire action plan, keeping children away from flammable materials, saving  emergency numbers in the phonebook, not doing electrical repairs by themselves, leaving the keys  on the entrance door were just examined in this study. These behaviour determinants are  important to improve positive behaviour. Among the factors as housing type, in this study, the  status of having positive behaviour on house fires is significantly higher in participants lived in a  dorm than living in family residence and living alone. This can be explained that there are  encouraging factors such as controlling and supporting peer to have positive behaviour. However,  in Turkey, there are many problems with fire services (Yentürk et al., 2002; Uygun and Inal, 2019).  The firefighting services are not well developed, fire brigade approaches and services are old and  inadequate, the fire precautions of many buildings are not sufficient, the building load is excessive.  In these circumstances individual protective behaviours gain importance. In a study reporting the  development and testing of a building evaluating parental fire safety behaviors for planning  escape from a house fire, the best fit for the data was given with a two-class model, combining  responses to five fire safety planning behaviors, and corresponding probabilities were identified  for each fire safety variable for both classes. It was reported that the group who were more fire  safety behaviour to escape from a house fire comprised 86 percent of participants most likely to  have a torch, be aware of how their smoke alarm sounds, have accessible external door and  window keys, and exit clear. The group that had less fire safety behaviors to escape from a house  fire included 14% of participants who were less likely to report these five behaviors. Furthermore,  in stated study, participants assigned to fire safety behaviour to escape from a house fire group  were 2.5 times more likely to submit an escape strategy (OR 2.48; 95 % CI 1.59–3.86) than those  with less fire safety behaviors to escape from a house fire group (Ploubidis et al., 2015). In the  study, positive behaviours on residential fires was found higher in the students stated that  training about fire than the students who did not. The result of this study revealed that training  about the prevention of fire has been quite effective in increasing the awareness of young people  about residential fires. However, earthquake comes to mind firstly within disaster groups in  Turkey, whereas fires are very common which mostly affects younger age groups (Ersoy, Kocak,  2016). However, modern individual prevention approaches to fires are not taught in schools  (Ersoy, Kocak, 2016). Information and trainings on residential fire should be given to all people  especially to young individuals in the community.   The mean age of the participants in the study was 20.1±2.3 years and they were the risk group for  house fires. Young age and low socioeconomic status are among common risk factors for  residential fire death in urban paediatric emergency department patients (Wood et al., 2016).  Close to 75% of young children's burns came from hot liquid, heated tap water or steam. The  burns they experienced are typically the result of hot drink scalds or touch burns from radiators  or hot water pipes (Agran et al., 2003). In Finland, an 11-years study found that 50 percent of  burns were due to electricity in the 11–16-year group, while the other 50 percent were due to fire  and flames (Peden, 2008). Smoking was the majör cause of fatal fires in residential areas (Hall,  2004).   Haddon Matrix is suggested to analyse and prevent injury of all types. The matrix as a framework  summarizes the risk and protective factors, and sets out the various preventive approaches, both  effective and promising. It is suggested for fire related burns among children that on the pre-event  phase, lack of information about the risks of fire at home, sex, household storage of flammable  objects, matches or lighters available to children are the important factors. For on the event phase,  unmaintained smoke alarms and sprinkler systems, poor knowledge about evacuation  procedures, lack of access to telephone to call for help were risk factors (Peden, 2008). This study  showed that 79.9% of the participants did not do electrical repairs by themselves; 36.8% did not  use more than one multiple adapter in power outlets and 27.1% save emergency numbers in the  phonebook (to remember in case of panic). These are important behaviours to prevent residential  fires. This result reveals that fire prevention behaviour was quite prevalent among the young, also,  a great number of students did not save emergency numbers in the phonebook to remember in     Are Sociodemographic Characteristics and Experiences Associated to Behaviours on Residential Fires?   A Young Adult Sample   166     case of panic. Thus, it is very important to give a point of view about these behaviours’ necessity  and importance in the schools. In a prospective, quasi randomized controlled study determined  the effect of community based fire prevention interventions on the awareness and actions of fire  protection in primary school was described as a modest increase in fire safety actions among  children whose families received a fire prevention indicating a shift in household fire safety  practices, but no substantial change was observed in fire safety knowledge among groups (Hwang  et al., 2006). Sex is an important factor on fire safety in some studies (Jonsson et al., 2017; Xiong,  Bruck and Ball, 2015). Girls' fire-related death rate was 4.9 per 100,000 population, compared  with 3.0 per 100,000 for boys (Peden, 2008). The difference was especially marked in infants and  adolescents aged 15 to 19 years (Peden, 2008). The age of this group had greater exposure,  experimentation and risk taking (Peden, 2008). In this study, there was no statistically significant  difference in behavioural status between the different categories of participants’ age and sex. In a  survey conducted in Sweden, it was reported that male sex, old age, smoking, and alcohol were  identified as risk factors (Jonsson et al., 2017).   The study had some limitations. The study sample size was restricted to a group comprising of a  vocational school, not to students of all higher education programs of the country. Therefore, the  findings of this study can not be generalized to all young adults in Turkey. Furthermore, there are  very few researches studied in this area. Furthermore, fire-setting behavior can be seen in  association with various psychiatric and behavioral disorders in childhood, adolescence, and  adulthood. Within the scope of the study, no evaluation was made for this group.    This study showed that positive behavioral status on residential fires was associated with the  place where the participant lives in and having training about fire. Interventions aimed to increase  positive behaviors on residential fire should include the young people who live in family house or  who live alone in a house. Therefore, young people need to train on fire prevention, early response  and basic first aid for fire to reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity and the economic burden  of fire. Period of university education may be appropriate for those trainings. This study has  evaluated the behaviors of university students in Turkey related to residental fires. There are few  published studies on this subject so this study is very important in terms of prioritizing  intervention studies to be carried out.

KBRN silahlarının kolay elde edilebilir olması,  güçsüz devletlerin elinde  kontrolsüz bir güç kaynağı olmasına neden olmuştur. Kimyasal silahların üretimi, depolanması ve  kullanımını önleyici uluslararası kararlara, anlaşmalara ve baskılara rağmen, halen kontrolsüz bir  şekilde kullanılmasının önüne geçilememektedir. Bazı kimyasalların çift kullanım özelliklerinin  olması da ticari izinlerinde ve gümrük geçişlerinde kolaylık sağlamaktadır. Sınır ile gümrüklerden  geçişlerde kimyasalların tespitlerinin zorluğu ve erken uyarı sistemlerinin yaygın olmaması  tehlikeyi daha da artırmaktadır. İnsanların ve diğer canlıların sağlığını korumaktan sorumlu olan  kurum ve kuruluşların konuya önem vermemeleri ise durumu daha da tehlikeli hale  getirmektedir.    Afet tıbbına göre kimyasal savaş ajanlarıyla yaralanma ve yaralı yönetimi multidisipliner bir  yaklaşımı, çalışmayı ve koordinasyonu gerektirmektedir. Özellikle kimyasal silahlarla yaralanma  durumunda, yaralıya ilk temas anından itibaren sunulacak olan kurtarma ve sağlık hizmetlerine  dair standart uygulamalar ile algoritmalar hususunda akademik çalışmalar ülkemizde ne yazık ki  yok denecek kadar sınırlı sayıdadır. Bu belirsizliğin ortadan kaldırılması ve mevcut eksikliğin  giderilmesi amacıyla; bilim insanları, adli tıp uzmanları, sağlıkçılar, kimyacılar, mühendisler,  arama ve kurtarmacılar, itfaiyeciler, yönetim disiplini mensupları, hukukçular, lojistik uzmanları,  güvenlikle ilgili uzmanların ivedilikle ortak çalışmalar yaparak gerekli standart önleme ve  müdahale algoritmalarını belirlemeleri gerekmektedir.    Bu çalışmada; örnek bir süreç yönetimi olarak Suriye iç savaşında kimyasal silah olarak kullanılan  klor gazı yaralılarının ülkemizdeki tıbbi bakım süreçleri afet tıbbı açısından değerlendirilmiştir.

Since CBRN weapons are easily procurable, they became an untrammeled power supply  in the hands of weak states. Despite all international judgments, treaties and pressures preventing  production, storage and usage of chemical weapons, uncontrolled usage still has not been averted.  Dual-use feature of some chemicals provides convenience in their trading permissions and their  passing through customs. Because chemical detections are difficult and early warning systems are  not prevalent in border crossings and customs entries, there is an increasing danger. Disregard of  the agencies and institutions meant to be responsible from protecting human health and health of  other species, jeopardizes the situation more.    In terms of disaster medicine, management of injuries with chemical warfare agents and injured  peoples require a multi-disciplinary approach, study and coordination. Unfortunately, academic  studies regarding standard procedures and algorithms of rescue and health services provided to  the injured peoples as from the initial contact, - especially in the case of injuries with chemical  weapons- have a very limited availability. On the purpose of removing this uncertainty and  remedying the current deficiency; scientists, forensic science experts, health care providers,  chemists, engineers, search and rescue experts, firefighters, members of the managerial  disciplines, legists, logistics specialists and experts related to the security field urgently need to  determine required standard algorithms of prevention and response.    In this study; the medical care processes of chlorine gas as chemical weapons wounded in Syria  due to Syrian civil war are evaluated in terms of disaster medicine    Keywords: Disaster Medicine, CBRN, Chemical Weapon, Medical Care        1. GİRİŞ     Kimyasal, Biyolojik, Radyolojik ve Nükleer (KBRN) silahlar genellikle terör ve paniğe sebep olmak  amacı ile kullanıldıkları gibi kitlesel yok etme veya kapasiteyi bozma amacıyla da kullanılırlar.  KBRN silahlarının kolay elde edilebilir olması,  güçsüz devletlerin elinde kontrolsüz bir güç  kaynağı olmasına neden olmuştur (Öztürk, 2011).    Terörizmin tarihçesi çok eskilere kadar uzanır. Değişen dünya ve şartlar doğrultusunda  terörizmin metodolojisi ve yöntemleri de değişmiştir. “Küresel Asimetrik Tehdit” şeklinde  karşımıza çıkan küresel terör dönemiyle birlikte terör saldırılarının kim tarafından, ne zaman,  nerede, nasıl ve kimi hedef alacağı belirsiz bir hale gelmiştir. İletişim ve bilgiye sınırsız şekilde  erişim imkânı olan günümüzde teröristlerin işleri hem üretim hem de korunma açısından daha da  kolaylaşmıştır. Bundan dolayı günümüzde küresel terörle mücadele için uluslararası ve      Afet Tıbbı Açısından Kimyasal Silah Yaralılarının Yönetimi   22     devletlerarası işbirliği kaçınılmaz olmuştur. Bu gerçeğe rağmen uluslararası ilişkilerde devletler,  terörü bir koz olarak birbirlerine karşı kullanabilmektedirler (Türköz, 2016).    Suriye'de KS (CW)’ları sivil nüfusa karşı kullanıldığı iddiaları, uluslararası platformda sıklıkla  tartışılmıştır. Suriye Hükümet yetkililerince 2012 yılında, uzun süreli kimyasal silah üretim  çalışmaları olduğu kabul edilmiştir. Yetkililer, silahlı kuvvetler tarafından saklanan ve güvence  altına alınan silahların hiçbir zaman Suriye içinde kullanılmayacağını, ancak dış saldırılara karşı  kullanılacağını ifade etmişlerdir. Şubat 2014 tarihli BM İnsan Hakları Konseyi'nce hazırlanan bir  raporda, Khan-Al-Assal saldırısında kullanılan kimyasal ajanların, 2013 Ghouta saldırılarında  kullanılanlarla aynı özellikleri taşıdığı belirtilmiştir. 2013 yılında Suriye'deki ilk kimyasal  saldırıdan sonra diğer saldırılar art arda gerçekleştirilmiştir. Bu saldırılara ait harita Şekil 1’de ve  kronolojik süreç Tablo 1’de gösterilmektedir.       Şekil 1. Suriye’de meydana gelen kimyasal saldırıların yıllara göre dağılımı (Patocka, Jiri, 2016).     Suriye’de başlayan iç savaş esnasında, 23.11.2012 - 07.04.2018 tarihleri arasında Aleppo,  Damascus, Damascus banliyöleri, Daraa, Deir Ezzor, Hama, Homs, Idlib, Lattakia ve Raqqa’da  düzenlenen kimyasal gaz saldırılarında toplam 1298 kişi hayatını kaybetmiş, binlerce kişi  yaralanmıştır. Hayatını kaybedenlerin % 27,81’i yetişkin kadın, % 57,01’i yetişkin erkek, % 6,47’si  kız çocuk ve % 8,70’i ise erkek çocuktur (URL 1).    Bu kimyasal saldırılarda meydana gelen ölümlerin yıllara göre dağılımı Tablo 2’de,  yine kimyasal  saldırıların meydana geldiği yer ve hayatını kaybedenlerin sayısal dağılımı ise Tablo 3’te  verilmiştir.    Bu yaralılardan bir kısmı sınır kapılarımızdan ülkemize akut ve kronik tıbbi bakım amacıyla  getirilmiştir.

Bahse konu 18 vakanın 13’ü trakrium, atropin ve dormikum ile entübe edilmiş (%72.22) şekilde  Cilvegözü sınır kapısına getirilmiş, sınır bölgesinde uzmanlarca arındırma işlemi yapılarak Hatay  Devlet Hastanesine ambulanslarla nakledilmiş, hastanenin arındırma ünitesinde arındırma işlemi  uygulandıktan sonra acil ünitesine alınmışlardır.     Getirilen vakalardan 9’unun erkek, 9’unun kadın olduğu belirlenmiştir. Erkek ve kadınların her iki  grubun da yaşları 13 ile 40 arasındadır (ortalaması 21.55).    Vakaların tamamına “X49: Kimyasallar ve diğer ve tanımlanmamış zararlı maddelere maruz  kalma” ICD 10 tanı kodu verilmiştir. Bu vakalara ilişkin bazı klinik bilgiler Tablo 5’te  görülmektedir.    Acil ünitesinde Anexate 0,5 mg/ 5 ml ampul verilen hastaların 15-20 dakika sonra spontan  solunumlarının başladığı ve tamamının bilinçlerinin açıldığı tespit edilmiştir. Hastalar ekstübe  edilerek servise takip amaçlı çıkartılmıştır. Vakaların tamamına damar yolu açılıp oksijen destek  tedavisi verilmeye başlanmış, %0.9 NaCl 100 cc /saat hızında başlanmış, ilk 1000 cc’sinin içine 6  ampul N-Asetil Sistein ve prednizolon 100 mg ampul infuzyon şeklinde verilmiştir.

Yine vakaların tamamının fizik  muayenelerinde her iki akciğerde dinlemekle yaygın şekilde ral ve ronküs mevcudiyeti dikkat  çekmektedir.     18 vakanın tamamına radyo opak madde kullanılmadan akciğer tomografisi çekilmiş ve 5’inin  akciğerinde bilateral buzlu cam görünümü ve konsolidasyon alanları görülmüştür (%27.7). Bir  vakanın ise sağ akciğer orta lobunda mozaik atenüasyon paterni gözlenmiştir (%5.55). Bu  vakalardan ikisine ait BT görüntüleri Şekil 3’te görülmektedir.         Şekil 3. Vakalara ait BT görüntüleri a) 25 yaşında erkek hasta, her iki akciğer buzlu cam manzarası ve   konsolide alanlar (Hatay İl Sağlık Müdürlüğü Acil Sağlık Hizmetleri Başkanlığı, 2017), b) 14 yaşında erkek  hasta, akciğer bilateral üst loblarda ve sağ akciğer alt lobda multiple buzlu cam görünümü (Hatay İl Sağlık   Müdürlüğü Acil Sağlık Hizmetleri Başkanlığı, 2017).     Laboratuar tetkiklerinde ise; birinci ve ikinci gün yapılan biyokimya analizlerinde, 18 vakanın  15’inde (%83.33) Na+ değerlerinin normalin alt sınırlarında (136-140 mmol/L) olduğu dikkati  çekmiştir.    Vakaların tamamı 48 saat içerisinde şifa ile taburcu olmuşlardır.      3. TARTIŞMA     Klor gazı göz ve cilt irritasyonu, solunum yolu irritasyonu, solunum sıkıntısı ve öksürük, boğaz  ağrısı ve göğüste sıkışma hissi oluşturur. İnsana etkili olan havadaki ölçülebilir konsantrasyonu 2  mg /m3, insanların tolere edemediği havadaki ölçülebilir konsantrasyonu 25 mg /m3’tür.  Araştırmaya dahil edilen toplam 23 vakanın tamamının 25 mg/m3’ten daha yoğun klor gazına  maruz kaldıkları klinik bulgu ve görüntüleme analizlerinden anlaşılmaktadır.    İkinci Dünya Savaşında kullanılan klor gazının etkilerinin incelendiği kohort araştırmasına göre;  klor gazına kısa süreli maruz kalan 685 vakanın araştırıldığı saha gözlem araştırmasında mortalite  oranı %5’in üzerinde olduğu, hayatta kalanlarda ise bronşit semptomlarının bulunduğu  belirtilmiştir. Aynı araştırmanın maruziyetten sonra 4 ay süre geçen 562 kişiden oluşan bir  gruptaki fizik muayene kayıtları araştırmasına göre; araştırma grubunun %30’unda bronşit ve  %22’sinde amfizem geliştiği belirlenmiştir. Yine aynı araştırmanın maruziyetten sonra 10 yıl süre  geçen 96 kişiden oluşan bir gruptaki fizik muayene kayıtları ve göğüs röntgenleri üzerinde yapılan  bir araştırmaya göre; araştırma grubunun %10’unda kesinlikle klora bağlı, %7’sinde muhtemelen  klora bağlı bronşit ve/veya amfizem olduğu, %83’ünde ise klora bağlı herhangi bir sağlık problemi  olmadığı belirlenmiştir (Das R, 1993).   a b     Afet ve Risk Dergisi Cilt: 3 Sayı: 1, 2020 (20-30)                               İlhan ÖZTÜRK, Ethem GÜNEREN, Alpaslan  MAYADAĞLI, Özcan ERDOĞAN   29       12.04.2014 ve 21.04.2014 tarihlerinde Reyhanlı Cilvegözü sınır kapısından getirilen kimyasal  saldırı vakalarında her iki akciğerde dinlemekle kaba ral ve ronküsler (%80), solunum sıkıntısı  (%100) ve akciğerlerinde yaygın infiltrasyon alanları (%60) tespit edilmiştir. Vakalardan biri  oksijen ve destek tedavisine rağmen satürasyonlarının düşmesi sonucu entübe edilmiş, yoğun  bakım ünitesinde Akut Respiratuar Distres Sendromu (ARDS) gelişmesi sonrası ex olmuştur  (%20). İkinci Dünya Savaşındaki mortalite oranıyla aradaki farkın %15 gibi bariz bir şekilde fazla  olmasının nedenleri; maruz kalınan gazın yoğunluğu, Suriye sınırları içerisinde acil müdahale ve  solunum destek imkanlarının kısıtlı ve yetersiz seviyede olması, tıbbi bakımda gecikme olması  sayılabilir.    04.04.2017 tarihinde Reyhanlı Cilvegözü sınır kapısından getirilen kimyasal saldırı vakalarında  solunum sıkıntısı nedeniyle entübe (%72.22), her iki akciğerde dinlemekle kaba ral ve ronküsler  (%100), akciğer bilgisayarlı tomografi (BT)’lerinde buzlu cam görünümü (%16.66) ve periferik  kanda sodyum (Na+) değerinin normal seviyesinin alt sınırına düştüğü (%83.33) tespit edilmiştir.  Bunun nedeni; hücre dışı ortamdaki anyon ve katyon dengesinin bozulması olarak  değerlendirilmiştir. Bu vakaların tamamı oksijen desteği verilerek şifa ile taburcu olmuşlardır.     4. SONUÇLAR     Kimyasal silah maruziyeti olan tüm vakaların tıbbi bakım süreçleri uzmanlık, büyük önem ve  dikkat gerektiren bir süreçtir. Başta doktorlar olmak üzere tüm sağlık personeli ve sahada aktif  görev alan herkesin; kimyasal silahların sağlığa olan etkileri, korunma yolları, antidotlar,  kişisel  arındırma ve yaralı arındırma yöntemleri, sağlık olay yeri ve hastane yönetimi, ajanın çeşidine  göre sahada ve hastanede tıbbi bakım süreçleri hususlarında eğitilmesi ve düzenli olarak  tatbikatlar düzenlenmesi büyük önem taşımaktadır.     Klor gazı teması olan vakalarda klinik bakım esnasında solunum fonksiyonları düzenli olarak takip  edilmeli, solunum fonksiyon testleri ihmal edilmemeli, tespit edilen fonksiyon eksikliği  gecikmeksizin desteklenmeli ve tedavi edilmelidir  .  Kitle imha silahı temaslısı bir vaka geldiğinde HAP KBRN prosedürleri gereği vaka acile alınmadan  önce kimyasal kalıntı olup olmadığı tespit edilmeli, arındırma yeterliliği kontrol edilmelidir.  Kimyasal tespit edilirse arındırma yapılmadan acil ünitesine vaka kabulü yapılmamalıdır.     Arındırma ünitesi; acile yakın ancak hareketli, ayaktan ve sedye ile getirilen yaralıların aynı anda  birbirlerini engellemeyecek şekilde tesis edilmelidir. Kitlesel yaralanma durumunda, ayaktan ve  sedye ile gelecek yaralıların arındırma süreleri göz önüne alındığında can kaybının artacağı  kaçınılmaz bir sonuç olacaktır. Kitlesel arındırma ihtiyacına karşılık gerekli altyapı referans  hastanelerde tesis edilmelidir. Kitlesel arındırma amacıyla, hastane aciline uygun mesafede,  kurbanların toplu olarak arındırılabileceği açık alan arındırma sistemleri tesis edilmelidir.      KAYNAKLAR    Das R, B. P.

It seems  that the main source of these problems is the inadequacies in natural disaster training. The main  starting point of the study is that acquisitions about natural disasters in all the curricula in  Turkey do not contribute to the natural disaster literacy in terms of quality and quantity. For this  reason, a natural disaster literacy course curriculum has been proposed for high schools. In the  study, the basic philosophy and general objectives of the natural disaster literacy course  curriculum have been defined. In the curriculum, the acquisitions that are convenient to the  dimensions of natural disaster literacy (knowledge-attitude-behavior); skills and values related  to those acquisitions and units have also been included. The natural disaster literacy course,  which has been planned to be 2 course hours per week at the level of 9th grade, consists of 5  units and 49 acquisitions. It is recommended that the study to be examined and applied in the  form of a sample curriculum. Thus, students are expected to be natural disaster literate. It is  thought that the increase in the number of individuals who are natural disaster literate will  decrease the material and immaterial damages caused by natural disasters.      Keywords: Natural disasters, Curriculum, Literacy, Acquisition       Doğal Afet Okuryazarlığı Dersi Öğretim Programı Önerisi      Özet  Türkiye’de ve Dünya’da doğal afet kaynaklı sorunlar her geçen gün artmaktadır. Bu sorunların  temel kaynağı doğal afet eğitimindeki yetersizlikler olarak görülmektedir. Çalışmanın ana  gerekçesi Türkiye’de tüm öğretim programlarındaki doğal afetlerle ilgili kazanımların nitelik ve  nicelik olarak doğal afet okuryazarlığına katkı sağlamamasıdır. Bu gerekçe doğrultusunda liseler  için bir doğal afet okuryazarlığı dersi öğretim programı önerisi getirilmiştir. Çalışmada doğal  afet okuryazarlığı dersi öğretim programının temel felsefesi ve genel amaçları açıklanmıştır.  Öğretim programında doğal afet okuryazarlığı boyutlarına (bilgi-tutum-davranış) uygun olan  kazanımlar; bu kazanımlarla ve üniteler ile ilintili beceri ve değerlere de yer verilmiştir. 9. sınıf  düzeyinde haftada 2 ders saati olarak düşünülen doğal afet okuryazarlığı dersi 5 ünite ve 49  kazanımdan oluşmaktadır. Çalışmanın örnek bir öğretim programı şeklinde incelerek  uygulamaya konulması önerilmektedir. Bu sayede öğrencilerin doğal afet okuryazarı olması  beklenmektedir. Doğal afet okuryazarı birey sayısının artması ile doğal afet kaynaklı maddi ve  manevi zararların azalacağı düşünülmektedir.

INTRODUCTION    The curriculum is a program that aims to gain specific categories of knowledge, attitudes and  skills in accordance with the objectives of the educational program (Küçükahmet, 2009). The  first and important condition in the preparation of a curriculum is the presence of a need. The  development of curricula should be carried out with a student-oriented program design in line  with the needs of the society. Curricula that do not meet the requirements of the age lose their  importance over time or the development of new curricula in line with the needs of the age  comes to the fore. In other words, curricula prepared according to the needs and realities of the  age will make a significant contribution to the society.    In this study, natural disaster literacy curriculum model has been proposed. First of all, although  there are different types of disasters (natural-human-extraterrestrial), the impact of natural  disasters among them is enormous. Furthermore, it is known that disasters of natural origins  play a role in the occurance of human originated ones. The most important factor in the proposal  of this curriculum is that the frequency of natural disasters in Turkey have been increasing  recently. Human beings have basically no effect on the occurrence of natural disasters. However,  efforts to minimize the hazards caused by natural disasters and preparations for disasters can  be done consciously. Therefore, natural disaster training should be provided. As Sözcü (2019a)  stated, natural disaster literacy is closely related to the education level of the people of a  country. If natural disaster literacy does not improve, many economic, social and psychological  problems may arise during and after a disaster.     The most remarkable problem is the loss of trained human resources due to natural disasters. In  this regard, raising the youth of countries as natural disaster literate will minimize the problems  likely to be experienced.     In this context, natural disaster literacy will enable the individual as a citizen to understand a  natural disaster problem in detail, to be able to apply the stages of analysis, synthesis and  evaluation, and eventually to make healthy and conscious decisions.    When the literature is examined, there are various reasons for the need for a natural disaster  literacy course. In his Ph.D. research, Sözcü (2019a) defined the natural disaster literacy levels of  prospective teachers through scales he developed. The results of the research concluded that the  natural disaster literacy levels of prospective teachers, who are the teachers of the future, are  not sufficient. Sözcü and Aydınözü (2019) examined the acquisitions of the courses at all  education levels and found if they are directly or indirectly related to natural disasters. They  examined the relationship between these acquisitions and the dimensions of natural disaster  literacy. As a result of the study, it was found that the acquisitions related to natural disasters at  all levels of education were insufficient and did not adequately serve the dimensions of natural  disaster literacy. Disasters and disaster management courses have been added to the program in  the last semester of geography and social studies teaching departments with the new  undergraduate programs. There should be a course through which the prospective teachers who  receive this training, can share the outcomes of this training in formal education. In 2005, with  the fundamental changes made in the programs of all educational levels, secondary school  programs included the sub-discipline of disaster prevention and safe living. Although the  number and quality of the acquisitions related to natural disasters seem to have improved  relatively thanks to the sub-disciplines, the fact that the acquisitions are not considered in the  context of information size-weighted intensity and natural disaster literacy, is seen as a  deficiency. Above all these negative situations, the change in the curricula in 2018 abolished the  disaster prevention and safe living sub-discipline. When all these studies and changes are taken  into consideration, it is obviously seen that the natural disaster literacy course is necessary.     Natural Disaster Literacy Curriculum Proposal   72     Considering all these studies and changes, the need for a natural disaster literacy course has  emerged in order to overcome the shortcomings. For this reason, the aim of this study is to  design natural disaster literacy curriculum.      2. METHOD    In this research, document review method, one of the qualitative research methods, was used.  Within the scope of the research, documents were reached as a result of the literature review.  The documents were obtained from the education programs of primary, secondary and high  school courses of the Ministry of National Education (URL-1, URL-2, URL-3, URL-4) and the  disaster protection and safe life intermediate discipline in the previous education programs. The  data obtained by document analysis was analyzed by content analysis method. As a result of  content analysis, acquisitions have been created for natural disaster literacy. Curriculum design  has been prepared in accordance with the curriculum designs of the Ministry of Education. In  this study, natural disaster literacy course is generally designed for high school level. In this  context, the philosophy of the natural disaster literacy course, general objectives, the skills and  values to be acquired, the acquisitions that will constitute the content of the course are included  in the study.    2.1. The Philosophy and the General Objectives of the Curriculum    From the formation of the world to the present, natural disasters are experienced in a natural  circulation. The number of natural disasters in which there is no human impact at the source is  increasing day by day. Even the natural disasters that occur in the most remote corner of the  world can be followed all around the world owing to the rapidly developing technology and  communication. Moreover, the rapid and excessive increase in the world population increases  the loss of life and property caused by natural disasters. Natural disasters that occur without any  relation to borders of countries are now attracting attention both nationally and globally.  Natural disaster literacy needs to be put on the agenda in order to reduce the material and  immaterial losses of people. New generations need to be trained not only to have knowledge of  natural disasters but also to develop attitudes against natural disasters and turn those attitudes  into behavior.   A natural disaster literate person is expected to be equipped with knowledge,  attitudes and behaviors against natural disasters, setting an example to the people around them  as well as being able to survive in the basic sense.    It is aimed with the natural disaster literacy program developed in this context that the  individuals who will become natural disaster literate as a result of the program (Sözcü, 2019b,  p.78);     1- will know the boundaries and principles of nature,  2- will understand the basic principles of natural disaster systems,  3- will know how to evaluate the reliable and scientific information related to natural   disasters,  4- will be able to take conscious and responsible decisions before, during and after the   natural disasters,  5- will be aware of the basic relationship between natural disasters and human beings and   the social consequences natural disasters can cause,  6- will be able to analyze the effect of economic activity on natural disasters,  7- will be able to conduct many acts from following the meteorological reports to choosing   the locations to live consciously and apply them to their life,  8- will be able to compare the national and international studies in the scope of natural   disaster recovery,  9- will know that the natural disaster recovery should have a cultural scale,        Journal of Disaster and Risk Volume: 3 Issue: 1, 2020 (70-79)                           Ufuk SÖZCÜ   73     10- will be aware of the destruction natural disasters can cause in the environment,  11- will be able to produce ideas to reduce the destructions of natural disasters and take   concrete steps,  12- will be able to voluntarily take part in events on natural disaster trainings,  13- will be able to analyze the reasons and results of the natural disasters where they live,  14- will be able to follow the initiatives of executives for natural disasters and give warnings   as much as possible,  15- will be able to contribute to turning natural disaster literacy into culture by transfering   the knowledge they have to the people and especially the youth around them.    2.2. Skills and Values    There are a number of skills students are expected to develop with the natural disaster literacy  program. These skills, some of which are also included in the curriculum of geography courses  (URL-1); are geographical observation, fieldwork, mapping skills, spatial analysis and social  participation.  Geographical observation will contribute to the realization of natural phenomena and  understanding the place of these phenomena in natural processes. The ability to perceive the  processes in the transformation of nature's mobility into the dimension of danger and disaster,  to analyze the similarities and differences natural disasters have with other phenomena and to  make predictions for the possible phenmena in the future.    Fieldwork will help students to gain first-hand information by visiting natural disaster risk areas  or areas that have encountered natural disasters through scientific research and reporting  stages.    Mapping skills will provide information about where natural disasters occur and the distribution  of natural disasters on the earth. In the light of the information, analyzes will be made on the  map and other factors related to the distribution of natural disasters will be related.    Spatial analysis will enable us to comprehend the situation of the living space according to  natural disasters, to use the space correctly and consciously against natural disasters and to  evaluate the space in the most accurate way possible after natural disasters. Spatial analysis will  help students become aware of the place they live and examine it from a scientific point of view.  Social participation skills will gain students the ability to act together against positive or  negative phenomena in society. With this skill, students will be able to participate in search and  rescue, to interfere, to participate in first aid, material and immaterial aid and support after a  natural disaster.    Values are at the heart of the natural disaster literacy curriculum as they are in all curricula. The  value judgments should also be developed in order that the acquisitions and skills the students  are expected to gain, have a meaning. It is important that the dimensions of information and  behavior expressed in natural disaster literacy are supported by the dimension of attitude. For  this reason, the values that can be associated with natural disasters are included in the  curriculum. These values are being scientific, solidarity, sensitivity, responsibility and  helpfulness.    The value of being scientific will contribute to define how natural disasters occur in the light of  science and to plan the actions to be taken during prevention, intervention and improvement  phases. Responsibility requires individuals to do their part against natural disasters that may  occur in their environment.       Natural Disaster Literacy Curriculum Proposal   74     When sensitivity is considered within the context of sensitivity to the natural environment, it  requires to act with the knowledge that human activities that are not suitable for the natural  environment will trigger natural disasters; solidarity and helpfulness require co-operation in  material-immaterial aid after any natural disaster.    2.3. Issues on the Implementation of the Curriculum    The natural disaster literacy curriculum focuses on the individual learning of the student. In the  curriculum, the teacher has a role that directs, encourages and contributes to the process of the  student at certain stages. The student is the person who observes, investigates and interrogates.  The implementation phase of the curriculum consists of the dimensions of knowledge-attitude  and behavior.     Students are not only the people who acquire knowledge, but also the people who develop  attitudes with the knowledge they acquire and turn them into behavior. The focus of the  curriculum is research-analysis based learning strategy. In this context, students are expected to  carry out in-class studies as well as out of class studies. Environments in which information is  structured through problem solving and cooperative learning is emphasized should be provided.  Field studies, institutional visits, interviews with experts, theoretical and practical  demonstrations will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the program.    As a measurement and evaluation approach, both result and process oriented evaluation should  be performed. Depending on the constructivist understanding, it is useful to provide students  with multiple assessment opportunities. In addition to traditional assessment tools, alternative  assessment methods such as performance tasks, student product files, project preparation, field  observation reports self / peer assessment should also be employed.    2.4. Structure of the Curriculum    It is recommended that the natural disaster literacy course curriculum be compulsory at the  level of 9th grade and 2 lessons per week. The units for the proposed program, the number of  acquisitions, and the recommended course hours are as in Table 1.     Table 1.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION    In recent years the number of natural disasters in the world and Turkey, there has been a  significant increase in life and property losses caused by the disaster. Taking precautions against  this situation is possible with natural disaster training. When foreign studies are examined,  Brown, Haun and Peterson (2014) suggested disaster literacy model for vulnerable groups.  Accordingly, disaster literacy model can be used with other risk and communication models  guide the development of educational materials that meet the needs of vulnerable subgroups  and help them progress to higher disaster literacy levels. Sampurno, Sari and Wijaya (2015)  aimed to improve students' disaster literacy. This paper discusses about innovation strategy to  build students ’disaster literacy through integrating STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,     Natural Disaster Literacy Curriculum Proposal   78     Mathematics) and disaster (STEM-D) education. In addition, Kanbara et al. (2016) disaster risk- reduction literacy, Chung and Yen (2016), Rahim and Wu (2015) disaster prevention literacy,  Kimura et al. (2017) disaster management literacy and Goddard (2017) worked on disaster  preparedness knowledge, beliefs, risk-perceptions. These studies do not have a curriculum  development feature. Therefore, in the research, a curriculum for natural disaster literacy course  was developed and proposed. The acquisitions of the curriculum are not limited to the  dimension of information. As it is thought that being a natural disaster literate will be possible  by reaching the levels of attitude development and behavior, acquisitions have been focused on  these dimensions. When the current curriculum acquisitions are evaluated by Sözcü and  Aydınözü (2019) it has been tried to overcome the shortcomings of the gains regarding the  behavior dimension. In addition to the basic philosophy and general objectives of the  curriculum, the values such as geographic observation, fieldwork, mapping skills, spatial  analysis, social participation skills and being scientific, responsibility, solidarity, sensitivity to  natural environment and helpfulness are also defined. With the practice of this curriculum,  students are expected to be natural disaster literate. The proliferation of individuals with natural  disaster literacy is thought to contribute to the reduction of material and immaterial damages  caused by natural disasters. Therefore, it is recommended that the competent units of the  Ministry of National Education initiate this program as a pilot scheme.       REFERENCES    Brown, L. M., Haun, J. N., & Peterson, L.

Since education, which is one of the basic  parameters of a country's development, is directly proportional to the investment given to it, the  land allocated to educational facilities are among the main priorities of a qualified education.   In this study, data were collected on the areas of educational facilities in the Western European  and American urban areas. The data obtained are compared with the regulations in Turkey. Upon  this, it has been tried to discuss with an example how the optimum educational facility area should  be proportional to the population.

When the educational facilities are categorized,  another parameter that is as important as the coefficient value is the service area radius value.  When determining the service area radius, the training facility area is considered the center of a  circle. Then a circle is drawn in the dimensions of the service area radius, which is defined as the  walking distance according to the type of facility. The area within this circle indicates the areas  that the educational facility needs will meet.   The educational facility area data is in direct relation with the number of population and the  coefficients to be determined for these facilities. The higher the population, the higher the demand  of the training facility, the more the educational facility will tend to increase. However, the basis  of this is the proportion of nuance education facilities with the population in the region. In other  words, where the population density is high, the coefficients used in the training facility  calculations should be taken high. Because the educational facility is one of the most important  elements of the concept of urban areas, which are the main components of the socio-cultural life  of the city, together with the green areas.   In this article; in the settlements of the developed countries where the majority of the urban  population is concentrated, the coefficient of education facilities from kindergarten to high school  and the service diameters are emphasized. In this study, it is tried to put forward a proposal about  what kind of coefficients should be acted in an ideal planning study.     2. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS IN EDUCATION FACILITY   It is not easy to determine the values of a public urban area parameter by country.  This is also the  case for the educational facility area. In various regions of a country, the value may vary greatly.  Nevertheless, it can create a foresight by considering the standards applied in cities in Western  Europe and America.   The values should be applied according to the Spatial Plans Production Regulations (SPPR) in  force in Turkey are in Table 1. According to these values, it is compared to the extent of the  educational facilities in Istanbul. Also; Educational facility area coefficients are shown in the USA,  Germany, England, France, Italy, Portugal and Bulgaria. At the end of the table; international  norms and regulations in Turkey are set forth recommended considering the coefficient for  educational facilities (Polat, 2017).         For example:   While 0.36 m² kindergarten per capita is built in USA, the service area is 200 meters. The same  value is 0.50 m² / person and 500 meters according to SPPR.   1.30 m² / person is applied for primary schools in Germany and there is no concept of service area  radius. According to Turkey in SPPR, the value is 1.50 m² / person and the service area has a radius  of 500 meters. For Istanbul, the primary school area per person is 0.50 m².   In Italy, planning is done at a value of 1.00 m² / person in secondary schools. SPPR for Turkey 1.50  m² / person requesting the implementation of the value of the service area has a radius of 1,000  meters. This value is 0.25 m² / person currently in Istanbul.       A Suggestion For Educational Facilities In The Urban Planning   16     In France, the high school area per person is 1.60 m². SPPR has determined this value as 1.75 m²  / person and service area radius is 2,500 meters. The current high school area per capita in  Istanbul is 0.30 m².    According to the Spatial Plans Production Regulations of the educational facility in Turkey; for  kindergarten: 0.5 (m² / person), for primary school: 1.5 (m² / person), for secondary school: 1.5  (m² / person), for high school and other non-formal education institutions: 1.75 (m² / person)  according to paragraph 2 of Article 12, titled 'walking distance'; ""zoning plans, children's  playground, playground, outdoor sports hall, family health center, nursery, kindergarten and  primary school about 500 m., secondary schools approximately 1,000 m., high schools  approximately 2,500 m. in the domain can be planned "", is called (Ministry of Environment and  Urbanization of Republic of Turkey, 2014).

Because in Istanbul; for primary and secondary schools, there is 0.25 m² / person and 0.3 m² /  person for high schools. These data are 4 to 8 times lower than the regulation standards.    3. A SUGGESTION FOR EDUCATIONAL FACILITY STRUCTURES   It has been tried to develop a proposal within the framework of the data, standards and current  situation described above. This recommendation is a mathematical model base that is defined by  the coefficients of boundary values. While determining the coefficient of an educational facility, 8  different situations were considered.

For example; what is the area of the educational institution that is needed in a residential area  with a population of 5,000 and no educational facilities within walking distance.   Legend 7 should be selected according to Table 3. In this case, the limit value coefficient will be  4.50 m2 / person.      Population (person)  x   Draft Educational Facility    Area Coefficient (m²/person) =   Draft Educational    Facility Area (m²)   5.000 4,5 22.500     According to this analysis, a total facility area of 22,500 m² is needed. If a coefficient is made with  coefficients; 22.500 m² of area; 2.500 m² of the kindergarten (0.5 coefficient), 12.500 m² of  elementary school (2.5 coefficient), 7.500 m² of high school should be divided.    4. CONCLUSION   Whether the educational facility is sufficient or not is among the basic indicators of a country's   development index. In this context, various standards are set for what should be the educational   facility area in a region. The observance of these standards also points to the importance that the   country gives to education. This study focuses on areas that need to be allocated to education   facilities in new settlements or in places where urban transformation opportunities are gained.   Data and standards put forth in the World and Turkey, the question is that what should be the   amount of land in need of educational institutions have been investigated. In this context,   regulations are based on walking distances that are frequently used and various coefficients have   been determined.  These coefficients are recommendations. Especially in developed countries   with data for standard applications in Turkey to focus on the most optimal option-based   applications and have attempted to show the results with an example.

Environmental degradation, environmental pollution, flooding, high temperature,  erratic rainfalls etc. on life and livelihoods of the city people have posed Dhaka a risky, vulnerable,  unsustainable, unlivable and fragile city. In this context, this paper tries to measure resiliency  through identifying Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) of ward no. 28 under the jurisdiction  of Dhaka South City Corporation (Old Ward no. 64 of Dhaka City Corporation) considering five  dimensions-Physical, Social, Economic, Institutional and Natural. This ward is representing the  old Dhaka scenario which represents a segment of the capital of Mughal Bengal. There are some  major factors under every dimension that have been considered to measure the index. By giving  different weightage to different aspects finally CDRI has been measured for ward no. 28. The result  shows that the overall average CDRI value for ward no. 28 is 2.65, which indicates that the natural  disaster resiliency level is moderate. It also been suggested that by improving communication and  accessibility, enforcing zoning and density control by the concerned Development Authority,  partnership and collaboration with the people by social capital enhancement program; savings  liked insurance programs; leveraging of existing strength in terms of external institutional  networks, internal networks etc. can strengthen climate disaster resiliency in ward no. 28.

INTRODUCTION   Global climate is changing rapidly and making all natural hazards more frequent and severe in   nature. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world as a result of climate   change. The geographical location, industrialized development, high population density and low   resource base has posed serious climatic impact.  Dhaka, is now posing serious climatic impact   (Alam and Rabbani, 2007: 81-97). To overcome negative climatic impact, it is needed to prepare a   resilient city because a resilient city is able to sustain itself or ensuring safe and secured through   its systems by dealing with issues and events that threaten, damage, or try to destroy it. Godschalk   (2003) defined that resilience is important for two reasons. First, the vulnerability of technological   and social systems cannot be predicted completely, resilience the ability to accommodate change   gracefully and without catastrophic failure is critical in times of disaster. If we knew exactly when,   where, and how disasters would occur in the future, we could persuade our systems to resist them.   Second, people and property should fare better in resilient cities struck by disasters than in less   flexible and adaptive places faced with uncommon. Local community resiliency can be a tool with   regard to reduce climatic disasters in Dhaka city. Because, local community’s habituation and   awareness about the proper measures is able to withstand an extreme natural event without   suffering devastating losses, damage, diminished productivity, or quality of life and without a large   amount of assistance from outside the community (Mileti, 1999: 32–33).    Disaster resilience analysis has become an important tool in disaster mitigation, risk assessment   and decision-making in environmental, social, economic or technological areas (Nelson et al.,   2010; Norris et al., 2008; Cutter, Burton and Emrich, 2010 ).   Rapid climate change and increasingly extreme weather events have serious adverse impacts on   communities when poor disaster risk management policies are implemented.   The capital city of Dhaka now faces flood in the regular interval for many years. Besides, geological   condition, sea level rise, changing intensity of rainfall pattern, temperature, deforestation in upper   stream countries all these factors are acting catalysts behind increasing the intensity of flood. The   flood induced disaster which indicates the climate induced disaster is getting more apparent. This   study has estimated Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) for Ward no. 28 of Dhaka South City   Corporation (Old Ward no 64 of Dhaka City Corporation) considering the physical, economic,       Afet ve Risk Dergisi Cilt: 1 Sayı: 2, 2018 (81-92)          Md Moynul AHSAN, S. M Shah MAHMOOD, Nehir VAROL   83     social, institutional and natural dimensions because the vulnerability of cities population mainly   depends on the above influential dimensions. In this research, CDRI value has been calculated only   considering the flood hazard.     2. METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY  Resilience is  defined by Adger, 2000; Brown, 2016 as ability to withstand shocks and risks and   defined by Varol and Kırıkkaya, 2017 as the ability to overcome disasters and emergencies via   sociological, psychological and physical capacity of community and the system and ability to re-  reach equilibrium succesfully.    Toubin et al. (2014) focused on urban services and networks when discussing urban resilience.   Urban services are key to building urban systems; support some urban functions for example;   economy, society, and housing (Bruneau et al., 2003). Urban resilience focuses on the ability to   promote and maintain the supply and function of services (Kim and Song, 2018).    Tyler et al. (2014) determined urban functions as seven parts: (1) Water supply; (2) Flood   prevention and drainage; (3) Public health; (4) Tourism; (5) Solid waste management; (6)   Ecosystem management; and (7) Resettlement and Housing.     Shim and Kim (2015) categorized city resilience into the 3 categories: (1) Biophysical; (2) Built   environment; and (3) Socioeconomic.   Function classifications for measuring and defining urban climate resilience, shown in Table 1.   The divisions of function include the characteristics for maintaining a city’s basic services and   developing capacities to absorbing future impacts and stress from climate change disturbances   (Seelinger & Turok, 2013).

Housing, production,   consumption (commerce),   jobs      Developmental Function   This is based on the mutual relationships that   are required to help residents prosper and to   ensure the human capital of future   generations. This means that people need to   actively and continuously accept new things.      Innovation, social   interactions, education,   creativity      Sustainable Function   This function ensures that people, society, and   the economy function well for longer periods   of time.

Politics and participation,   public administration,   disaster prevention and   safety, public infrasture         In this study, the selected study area Ward No. 28 is selected mainly for understanding the existing   condition of resiliency of old Dhaka (Figure 1). Like other parts of old Dhaka, this ward is   characterized by the congested building structures, narrow roads, high population density, mixed   land use pattern etc. There are two Panchayets (Community Club) in the ward which contains 5   members who play active role for the community. Here the local people have old culture and   tradition and their social bondage is strong.    Both primary and secondary data has been used in this study. All relevant GIS database collected   from GaniBangla Limited who has prepared “Detailed Area Plan for Dhaka City (1995-2015)” and   necessary demographic and other household information of the study area has been collected   from Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2001. Primary data has been collected by a Focus Group   Discussion with community leaders consisting of 8 members. Weighted Mean Index (WMI)   method and Aggregate Weighted Mean Index (AWMI) have used to compute the scores for each   parameter and dimension respectively. The CDRI of the city is the simple average of the indexes   of the five dimensions- physical, social, economic, institutional and natural dimensions (Shaw,   2009). The index value ranges from 1 to 5. Higher CDRI values are equivalent to higher   preparedness to cope with climate change and disasters. The resilience index has been   interpreting below:   Resilience Index: A Resilience Index is an indicator of a community’s ability to reach and maintain   an acceptable level of functioning and structure after a disaster.  Resilience Index may be identified   as Low, Medium & High in different categories.   1. Low Resilience Index: A low resilience index indicates that a community should pay specific  attention to this category and should make effort to address the areas of low rating. If the  critical infrastructure category received this rating, then reoccupation of that community  may take more than 18 months before basic services are restored.    2. Medium Resilience Index: A medium resilience index indicates that more work could be  done to improve your resilience in this category. If the critical infrastructure category  received this rating, reoccupation of that community may take less than 2 months before  basic services are restored.   3. High Resilience Index: A high resilience index indicates that a community is well prepared  for disaster. If the critical infrastructure category received this rating, then the community  probably will not suffer or will have minimal damage (can be functional in less than two  weeks) to basic services.     Needless to say, these results of resilience index are not absolute values, but serve mainly as broad   policy guidance. Based on the results, the strengths and weaknesses of the ward of the five   dimensions are highlighted. Then some policy points and recommendations are suggested to       Afet ve Risk Dergisi Cilt: 1 Sayı: 2, 2018 (81-92)          Md Moynul AHSAN, S. M Shah MAHMOOD, Nehir VAROL   85     provide encouragement of city governments’ engagements in the specific institution and capacity   building.      Figure 1. Map of ward number 28 of DSCC.      3. ANALYZE CLIMATE DISASTER RESILIENCE INDEX  Measuring the climate disaster resilience for flood hazard is critical due to multi-dimensional   Analyses. At first, the identification of indicators that affect the disaster resilience of the study area   has been done. Then, calculation of CDRI value has been conducted to measure the resilience. In   this study, five dimensions have been identified including five individual parameters under each   dimension.    3.1. Physical dimension of the study area   Physical dimension includes different infrastructural components such as: electricity, water, road   network, accessibility and roads, housing and land use etc.    Electricity: It was informed from FGD participant’s opinion that, in ward no. 28, power  disruption occurred more than five times between 8:00am and 5:00pm and in 24 hours on an  average 12 hours of interruption has commonly occurred per day in study area. In this  situation, there are only 15% extent of the capacity of alternative emergency electric supply  systems (own or community group) to keep emergency service.     Water: The scarcity of water has taken an acute problem in the study area for the last few  years causing immense sufferings to the dwellers on the advent of the sweltering summer.  From the FGD, it has been identified that about 6 hours of interruption in water supply has     Assessment of Climate Disaster Resilience in Dhaka City: A Case Study of Ward No. 28 of Dhaka South City   Corporation   86     commonly occurred per day in this area and only 25% extent of the capacity of alternative  emergency of safe water supply systems in ward no.28.    Solid waste disposal: Around 80% solid waste was collected by the Dhaka City Corporation  (New DSCC) and remaining waste is left unattended and locally or openly dumped in this study  area. However, up to 15% of solid waste was treated before dumping.    Accessibility of roads: According to FGD opinion, about 10.93% of total land area was used  for transportation network in the study area. Almost all roads were paved. More than 71% of  roads have remained accessible during normal flood affected areas. On an average, 3-4 hours  of interruption have occurred after heavy rainfall in affected areas.    Housing and land use: About 86 % of people lived in their own house. Like other parts of old  Dhaka, mixed category land use prevailed. On the other hand, less than 10% of non-permanent  structures were available. More than 71% of houses could access during normal flood or water  logging.     3.2. Social dimension of the study area:   The social dimension includes different social components, such as: population, Health, education   and awareness, social capital, community preparedness etc.    Population: The population of this ward has been 25,599 with a high population density of  625 people/ acre in which 62% are male and 38% are female. In the case of age distribution,  around 62% population ranges from 18 to 60 years and only three percent population are  above 60 years (BBS, 2003). The population growth has calculated 4-5.9 % annually.  Percentage of population under 14 and over 64 is 29%. Percentage of population living in  informal settlement was only 4% (BBS, 2003). Most of the people have lived by inheritance.  So, the percentage of informal settlement rate was low in this ward.     Health: From the FGD opinion, it has been found that the capacity of the ward’s health facility  is poor because the responsible authority did not take any initiatives about disaster  management activities.    Education and awareness: Though literacy rate is 76.89% but awareness of knowledge of  population about the threat and impacts of disaster is poor (BBS, 2003). Still, most of the  people live with their traditional belief and knowledge. From FGD, the participants informed  that they are interested to alter their traditional knowledge. Because, it hampers their  livelihood activities if any natural or manmade disasters occur in the area. Five years have  passed ward office organized a public awareness program. Afterward, no other activities were  taken for awareness program of disaster.     Social capital: People sometimes participate at community level which is good practice  compared with other parts of Dhaka City. In the study ward 28, two Panchayet Committees  are involved in various community activities. From FGD participants, the extent of the ward’s  population participates in community activities are more than 41% which measured from  FGD. Local political leaders also have a very influential role in the area    Community preparedness during a disaster: From FGD participant’s opinion, it has been  found that people are not prepared for a disaster in terms of logistics, materials and  management. Local people are not aware of disaster due to lack of preparation.       3.3. Economic dimension of the study area   Economic dimension includes the following the components related to economic activities such as   income, employment, household assets, financial savings, budget and subsidiary.     Income: About 50-74% of households have both primary and secondary sources of income.  Most of the people are engaged in business activities in Chawk Bazaar (one of the oldest  business hubs in old Dhaka). As a result, their average income level is higher than their  surrounding area.         Afet ve Risk Dergisi Cilt: 1 Sayı: 2, 2018 (81-92)          Md Moynul AHSAN, S. M Shah MAHMOOD, Nehir VAROL   87      Employment: From the BBS (2003), there were about 30% of unemployed labors exist in the  study area. Women employment levels have been very low. They are mainly housewife.  Women education rate is very low in this study area.     Household assets: More than 92% households have television and mobile phone; 31-40%  have motorized vehicle and less than 30% have non-motorized vehicle in the ward.     Finance and savings: Access to credit facility has been found poor of financial institutions to  prevent disaster in the ward. The effectiveness of credit facility is poor during a disaster for  urban poor. From FGD, around 10% of residential households are under any sort of insurance  scheme.    Budget and subsidy: Ward commissioner did not allocate any portion of annual budget  targeting disaster risk management. No fund is available for climate change related disaster  risk reduction measures.       3.4. Institutional Dimension of the Study Area   It is evident that if the institutional set up has a good condition of a ward then it can be considered   that the area is more capable of disaster management. The flowing indicators are considered to   measure the resiliency of disaster.    Mainstreaming of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA):  All the concerned aspects and principles should be taken incorporated for the development  control to mainstream Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation. Nevertheless,  the ward 28 has not incorporated unexpectedly. Also the people of the ward have the poor  ability or opportunity to produce development plans for their area. The logistic support for  this has also opined poor. Even the ward does not incorporate the disaster management plan.    Effectiveness of Ward’s Crisis Management Framework: In the ward, there are many  young people to work for the community on voluntary basis. The people in Panchayets are  enthusiastic to help neighbors. In old Dhaka, the community sense is historic among the  residents. The social bondage is a great strength for them. During any disaster, the people  come forward to help others. Though there is no formal team to work in case of emergency  but the Panchayet committee is the informal team to work for the purpose.     Knowledge Dissemination and Management: People of old Dhaka have experienced many  disasters. But it is quite ambiguous matter about their learning from those. It is because of  their weak infrastructural condition. The major accidents occur and turn to hazard in old  Dhaka due to congestion of buildings, narrow roads etc. The people who are enthusiastic to  help others do not have proper training about the task in case of disaster. There is no effective  system of knowledge dissemination about disaster management by any government authority.     Institutional Collaboration with Other Organizations & Stakeholders: From FGD  participant’s opinion, it has been found that institutional collaboration was very low with  other organizations for managing any disaster.     Good Governance: Without ensuring governance, good management system cannot be  achieved. Good infrastructures are needed to ensure good governance. But in this ward it is  found that there is no early warning system for the disaster, no mock drills.      3.5. Natural Dimension of the Study Area    Intensity or Severity of Natural Hazards: The impact of flood hazard is normal. There may  be one occurrence of flood in every five years. The inhabitants of ward no 28 didn’t experience  any severe flood after 2004 because authority constructed drainage channel towards the  Buriganga River subsequent of flood. This drainage network was functioning well with its full  capacity. Water logging or flash flood was rare case and if there is water logging due to heavy  rainfall within short time, the severity was not much as the local people do not treat it as to  obstruct their daily normal activities.      Assessment of Climate Disaster Resilience in Dhaka City: A Case Study of Ward No. 28 of Dhaka South City   Corporation   88      Frequency of Natural Hazards: Average urban soil quality in terms of industrial  contamination is medium. Average urban air quality during the daytime is poor and urban  heat island effect prevails in the Ward. As the paved surface area is very high and green area  is very low, it has reduced the absorption capacity of soil in case of heavy rainfall and increased  the surface runoff.     Ecosystem Services: Ward 28 is located close to the river Buriganga. This river becomes  contaminated not only by the industrial waste generating from the area’s hazardous  industries but also polluted by the hazardous waste from other parts of Dhaka City. In case of  the other water bodies situated in the locality, they are polluted mainly for dumping of  domestic wastes.    Land Use in Natural Terms: Average intensity of land use- urban morphology (built area) is  71-90 %. Less than 10% settlements are located on hazardous ground (e.g. steep slope, flood  prone area) in the study ward. Vegetation condition is very poor and less than 1% of total area  has green space.    Environmental Policies: There is no implementation of environmental conservation policies  in this ward. Waste management system is poorly efficient in terms of Reduce, Reuse and  Recycle. Reduce is not yet documented in the waste management system of DCC. A section of  the poor people collects re-useable and re-cyclable waste materials form the  dustbins/containers and as well as from the streets and dumping sites. Still there is no formal  attempt for reusing the waste. Panchayet Committee collects domestic wastes from house to  house with minimum charge. After house to house collection of wastes, they are dumped into  the dustbins that are placed by Dhaka City Corporation (New DSCC) on roadside.       4. CLIMATE DISASTER RESILIENCE INDEX (CDRI) CALCULATION  The Climate Disaster Resilience of ward no. 28 has been calculated based on five dimensions under   which individual score of five parameters was measured. The score of parameters has measured   by determining the score of selected indicators under each parameter.      The score of a indicator Si1 =         (1)   Where,   Si1 = Score of Indicator i1 under specific parameter of a specific dimension   Ci1    = Choice for indicator i1   Wi1   = Weight factor of indicator i1    The same procedure is followed for other indicators under the identified parameters. Scores of all   indicators are then used to determine the score of parameters using following equation:            The score of parameter SP1 =         (2)      SP1 = Score of Parameter 1 of specific dimension    Wpi1 = Weight factor of parameter1    Scores of parameters were aggregated to obtain the total value of CDRI of identified dimensions.

On the other hand, economic condition of this ward is   poor having a score of 1.49 in scale 5.00. This type of low CDRI value has explained the vulnerable   condition of the ward in a natural disaster like flood. CDRI values of social, economic and   institutional dimensions are respectively 2.84, 2.24, and 2.60 which has indicated ward no. 28 is   in medium condition considering disaster resiliency. Therefore, the overall average CDRI value for   ward no. 28 is 2.65, which indicates that the natural disaster resiliency level is moderate. This has   been presented graphically.

CONCLUDING REMARKS   Knowing the causes and the impacts of the floods, an important issue remains to be solved which  is “how to get people ready for floods before they come” and “how to help people cope with floods”.  Two core elements such as flood preparedness and flood emergency management should  strengthen to reduce disaster risk, as these are directly address the needs and opportunities for  vulnerable communities. It also indicate/guide the strengthening and operations of government  agencies at different levels: national, district, sub-district and union. Again, enhancing  communication, coordination and cooperation between these stakeholders as well as maintaining  consistency with national disaster management and mitigation policy are highly needed. From the  study it has been observed that ward. No. 28 of Dhaka city corporation fall in medium condition  which indicates that more work could be done to improve resiliency of the ward. The following  some recommendations are suggested:   1. Disaster communication in the form of improving early warning systems and evacuation  planning and accessibility by well internal access (adequate with) will be a good in  building physical resilience. Communication with mobile and media can play effective role  in this respect.    2. Planning authority (Capital Development Authority or RAJUK) should enforce zoning  regulations and density control in the study area. The Detailed Area Plan (DAP) of RAJUK  must implement to reduce disaster risk with required facilities and infrastructures for  future.   3. Social capital enhancement program can be launched both in the Ward Commissioner  office and Panchayets to engage more partnership and collaboration with the people.   4. Leveraging of existing strength in terms of external institutional networks, internal  networks may also be strengthened while making climate disaster resilience a  development planning agenda.

But recently, big data information technology and social  media in particular has become an integral part of disaster management. Relevant information  taken from social media and the intelligent web has increased the situational awareness of  decision makers. Disaster management decisions have important impacts on; the safety of  disaster victims, environment, economic systems, organizations etc. Reliable, timely, consistent,  sufficient and qualified information is critical in the phases of disaster management.

Afet ve Risk Dergisi Cilt: 1 Sayı: 2, 2018 (114-125)                 Türkay DERELİ, Nazmiye ÇELİK, Cihan ÇETİNKAYA   115     According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), a  disaster is “a sudden, calamitous event that seriously disrupts the functioning of a community or  society and causes human, material and economic or environmental losses that exceed the  community’s or society’s ability to cope using its own resources” (IFRC, 2018). Disasters  potentially cause devastating economic losses, large affected communities and significant  environmental damages (Galindo and Batta, 2013). Thus; a sensitive emergency management  should be applied to minimize these effects. Information technology plays a significant role for  minimizing disaster effects. Recently big data information technology has become an integral part  of disaster management. Big data facilitates process automation, decision making, and allows  enhanced insight. It is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information values that  demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing (Su, 2018).  In this paper, a  literature review is done and some specific search syntaxes are used to determine studied  subjects in literature.  There are important literature studies integrated big data and disaster  management together but proposed study also considers social media specifically that is part of  unstructured big data. The role of social media for disaster management is important and which  studies have been done in this area is the significant question to determine future gaps. So, effects  of social media on disaster relief and disaster management are shown in this paper. The  remainder of the paper as follows: section 2 outlines the social networks statistics, section 3  describes research methodology and literature review. Section 4 is the conclusion section.     2.SOCIAL MEDIA DATA SOURCES  Social network data is one of the big data sources generated from the social media platforms such  as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Flickr. Social media analytics is being utilized by  organizations for gaining insight into big data.   Penetration of leading social networks in Turkey during 3rd and 4th quarter 2017 is shown in  Figure 1.       Figure 1. Social networks user counts in Turkey (Statista, 2018)     As shown in the figure, the most used social network is YouTube with a 55 percent penetration  rate. Twitter has 36 percent penetration rate that is significant rate for a micro blogging.        A Literature Review on Big Data and Social Media Usage in Disaster Management   116     Internet, social media, mobile use statistics in Turkey is shown in Figure 2.       Figure 2. Statistics of internet, social media, and mobile subscriptions (2017 Digital Yearbook)     It is clearly seen that using of internet is quite common in Turkey.   Twitter is one of the most popular websites which is used for micro blogging. The user can write  thoughts limited 140 words and other people can follow the blogs.  Countries based on number  of twitter users are shown in figure 3.        Figure 3. Leading countries based on number of Twitter users as of April 2018 (in millions) (Statista,   2018)     During this time interval, twitter had 10.8 million monthly active users in Turkey.      3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND LITERATURE REVIEW  The literature review has been divided into parts as follows:    3.1 Searching based on “Big Data” String  The sources of this study are the Scopus and Web of Science databases because of being largest  databases for academic papers. The first search syntax on Scopus is shown in Table 1.       Afet ve Risk Dergisi Cilt: 1 Sayı: 2, 2018 (114-125)                 Türkay DERELİ, Nazmiye ÇELİK, Cihan ÇETİNKAYA   117       Table 1. First search strings on Scopus   Database Search strings   Scopus (May 09,2018)      ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""big data"" )  OR  TITLE-ABS- KEY ( ""large-scale data"" )  OR  TITLE-ABS-KEY (  ""predictive analy"" )  AND  TITLE-ABS-KEY (  ""disaster relief"" )  OR  TITLE-ABS-KEY (  ""humanitarian supply chain"" )  OR  TITLE-ABS- KEY ( ""aid distribution"" )  OR  TITLE-ABS-KEY (  ""disaster help"" ) )     First of all, two main titles are considered. The first title is “big data” that includes ‘big data’, ‘large- scale data’, and ‘predictive analy’ words. The latter is “humanitarian supply chain” that includes  ‘disaster relief’, ‘humanitarian supply chain’, ‘aid distribution’ and ‘disaster help’ words.  Search  is resulted in 18 papers; 8 of them are conference papers, 5 of them are articles, 2 of them are  conference reviews, one of them is article in press and 1 of them is a book chapter. “Predictive  analy” is used because of including analysis, analyses, and analytic keywords (Gupta vd., 2017).   The second syntax on Web of Science is shown in Table 2.      Table 2. Search strings on Web of Science  Database Search strings   Web of Science(May 09,2018) TS=(""big data"" OR ""large-scale data"" OR  ""predictive analy"") AND TS=(""disaster relief""  OR ""humanitarian supply chain"" OR ""aid  distribution"" OR ""disaster help"")     Same strings are used in Web of Science as in the Scopus database. 9 results are handled. 5 of  them are articles and 4 of them are conference proceedings.   Only “disaster” search string is used for the second main title to search for a general point of view.  The third syntax on Web of Science is shown in Table 3.     Table 3. Comprehensive search on Web of Science  Database Search strings   Web of Science (March 19,2018) (TS=(""Big data"" OR ""large-scale data"") AND  TS=""disaster"")     Search is resulted in 167 papers. 92 of them are proceeding papers, 69 of them are articles, 5 of  them are reviews, 1 of them is a book review, and 1 of them is an editorial material.  Flow diagram  of first phase search is seen in Figure 4.   Some of important studies in the light of above mentioned strings are as follows:  Monaghan & Lycett (2013) discussed the big data phenomenon with its characteristics of volume,  velocity, variety, and veracity in humanitarian supply networks and emphasized the distinction  between humanitarian aid and development aid. Humanitarian aid efforts and impact of  delivering humanitarian relief was assessed in the light of big data techniques and technologies.           A Literature Review on Big Data and Social Media Usage in Disaster Management   118     Figure 4. Flow diagram for the first search phase     Papadopulos, et al.(2016) proposed a theoretical framework to indicate the role of big data in  disaster resilience for supply chains. They used unstructured big data included tweets, Google+,  YouTube, news, Facebook, WordPress and also structured data involved in disaster relief  activities after Nepal Earthquake in 2015. They examined the role of swift trust and quality  information in supply chain networks unlike other studies. 36,422 tweets were collected for  analysis and also 205 responses collected via disaster relief workers. They paid attention to the  importance of public-private partnerships, swift trust, information quality, critical infrastructure  resilience, community resilience and resource resilience using context of Nepal.    Cherichi & Larodec ( 2016) proposed an event detection system based on data obtained from  twitter. The aim of this system is determine new events, recognize temporal indicators and  classify significant events using big data values in the case of social events. Semantic analysis was  done into two clusters: positive class and negative class.    Mulder , et al. (2016) proposed the processes of “big data making” in their papers through  crowdsourcing open data platforms, within the framework of two crises: 2010 earthquake in Haiti  and the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. The study included humanitarian response. Aim of the study  was to discover what obstacles stood in the way of “big data making” approach.         Afet ve Risk Dergisi Cilt: 1 Sayı: 2, 2018 (114-125)                 Türkay DERELİ, Nazmiye ÇELİK, Cihan ÇETİNKAYA   119     Gupta, Altay, & Luo (2017) proposed a systematic literature review study using Scopus database.  They examined big data in humanitarian supply chain management using 28 journal papers after  eliminating unnecessary studies. Classification was done according to the various theories such  as the enablers for big data in humanitarian supply chain management (volume, variety, velocity,  veracity organizational mindfulness), the concerns identified in humanitarian supply chain  management (humanitarian logistics, remote sensing, information security, social media). The  future research directions were suggested in above mentioned fields.     3.2 Searching based on “Social Media” String  In another stage, a new search has been done.  Social media is a part of unstructured big data. The  studied area is narrowed and focused on social media. Different strings are used on the biggest  database Scopus for providing new results. So, based on these strings a new methodology search  is conducted.  The fourth syntax on Scopus is shown in Table 4.     Table 4. Search strings on Scopus based on social media  Database Search strings   Scopus (May 09,2018) ( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""social media"" )  AND   TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""humanitarian supply chain""  )  OR  TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""disaster relief"" )  OR   TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""aid distribution"" )  OR   TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""emergency management"" )   AND NOT  TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""predictive analy""  )  AND NOT  TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""big data"" )  AND  NOT  TITLE-ABS-KEY ( ""large-scale data"" ) )     ‘Social media’, ‘humanitarian supply chain’, ‘disaster relief’, ‘aid distribution’, and ‘emergency  management’ string words are used for analysis removing ‘big data’, ‘large-scale data’, and  ‘predictive analy’ string words. Search resulted in 306 papers; 137 of them are conference papers,  122 of them are articles, 16 of them are book chapters, 9 of them are articles in press and 9 of  them reviews. Subject area of these papers is shown in Figure 5.        Figure 5. Subject area of 306 papers on Scopus based on social media     As seen in the Figure 5, proportion of the studies based on social media and humanitarian fields  conducted within computer sciences subject area are greater than other areas.

Among accessed studies, 159 papers include disaster studies based on social media.  80 papers are determined among these 159 papers which used twitter platform for their studies.  Word cloud of studies based on twitter using their abstracts is seen in Figure 6.  At first glance,  ‘social’, ‘twitter’, and ‘response’ words are attracted the attention. In Figure 7, word frequencies  of word cloud is seen.      Figure 6. Word cloud of studies based on twitter        Figure 7. Word frequencies of word cloud     As can be seen in figure 7, social and information words are the most frequently used ones in  studies. When graphic is evaluated, response, crisis, and analysis words are striking among first  twenty words.   Some of important studies related social media context are as follows:   Caragea, et al.  (2011) proposed a classification study for the Haiti Earthquake. They developed  an information technology infrastructure, called “Enhanced Messaging for the Emergency  Response Sector” (EMERSE). EMERSE includes a twitter crawler component, an iPhone  application, machine translation and automatic message classification. The data set contained  3,598 text messages and manually labeled into 10 categories: medical emergency, food shortage,  water sanitation, collapsed structured, hospital/clinic services, people trapped, water shortage,  shelter needed, food distribution, and person news.   Landwehr, et al. ( 2016) proposed strength and weakness of twitter to determine the features  needed in a twitter system to assist disaster phases: planning, warning and response. They used  a specific implementation, called TWRsms within a local context, Padang Indonesia in order to   0  50  100  150  200  Word Frequencies  Word Frequencies      Afet ve Risk Dergisi Cilt: 1 Sayı: 2, 2018 (114-125)                 Türkay DERELİ, Nazmiye ÇELİK, Cihan ÇETİNKAYA   121     support early warning and planning tsunamis. The study resulted around some goals such as:  scalable to multiple types of social media and data volume, data survivability, interoperable with  existing and proposed systems, rapid processing for material useful etc.   Wang & Ye (2018) presented a social media analytic using four dimensions of social media (space,  time, content, and network) within natural disasters subject. They reviewed existing studies and  evaluated these study analyzes on four dimensions, summarized extensive techniques and  suggested research pros and cons in mining social media data.   Taking into consideration the years 2017 and 2018, some of the disaster related studies based on  twitter platform are shown in the Table 5.     Table 5.

CONCLUSION  In this study, a literature review is conducted considering big data and social media in the light of  disaster management and specifically disaster relief. So, with this literature review, the  importance of big data and social media in disaster management and disaster relief fields can be  identified. Such a literature studies allow defining opportunities and future gaps in the related  area. There are few studies about disaster management considering big data when literature is  analyzed. But recently, social media into big data has been used frequently for disaster  management studies. It is determined that most studies are done with twitter analysis. In  addition, the response phase of disaster management has been studied more frequently.  Additionally, proportion of studies based on social media and humanitarian fields conducted  within computer sciences subject area are greater than other areas. It is also seen that machine  learning algorithms have an important place in these studies. Furthermore; hurricane, flood and  earthquake have been studied more as disaster type. Victims can express their problems through  social media and information can be provided about their situation. Which aids victims require  are important after disaster and social media can facilitate the crisis situation. How many people  needs assistance, how to reach these people, and quantity of aids are the critical questions that  can be found the answers through social media. In addition, social media is important in terms of  raising awareness of people before disasters. It is also important for psychological support to       A Literature Review on Big Data and Social Media Usage in Disaster Management   124     victims after the disaster. As it can be seen, the impact of social media on disaster management  has not been overlooked, and the literature has begun to devote a large area to this topic.

Introduction   In terms of plant biodiversity, Antalya is one of   Turkey's richest provinces. The presence of sudden   altitude changes within short    distances, climatic variations from coastal to inland   areas, as well as variable topography contribute to   its rich diversity of species (Deniz et al. 2015).   Several floristic studies have been conducted in   various part of Antalya. These studies ensure that   the list of plant taxa distributed in Antalya and the   endemism ratio are continuously updated. Flora of   the Phaselis region have been published in a series   of papers by Göktürk (2015, 2016, 2017), titled the   Flora of the Ancient City of Phaselis I, II and III. The   last study listed 631 taxa belonging to 360 genera   and 84 families from this province. A floristic study   was carried out in the Kıbrıs River wildlife   development area by Fener and Aykurt (2019),   which listed 538 taxa belonging to 276 genera and   73 families. The Kaş-Kekova Specially   Environmental Protected Area (SEPA)   Determination of Biodiversity Project was carried   out in 2010, and 272 species were identified by   project team (IntKyn. 1).    The aim of the present study was to contribute to   the flora of the area between İnceburun and   Çayağzı. The study area is found in the C2 square   according to the grid square system of Davis (1965-   1985) and is located within the Mediterranean   phytogeographical zone. We consider that floristic   studies are still necessary for the development of   conservation strategies and the management of   the unique Mediterranean maquis in Antalya.      2. Material and Method   2.1 Study area   In this study, the flora of the area between   İnceburun and Çayağzı was examined (Figure 1).   The study area comprises Çayağzı region (Demre)   and Kaş-Kekova SEPA, and is located in the   province of Antalya and the western   Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Kekova Island and   the surrounding coast were declared a Specially   Protected Area in 1990 to protect the biological   diversity and cultural richness. As a result of some   projects carried out between 2002 and 2006, and   with the decision of the Council of Ministers, the   boundaries of Kekova Specially Protected Area   have been extended to include the coastline and   the islands in the west, up to Inceburunin Kaş. The   protected area has been renamed as the Kaş-  Kekova Specially Environmental Protected Area   (Official Gazette dated 2006). The SEPA covers a   total area of 258.3 km2 and it is composed of 166   km2 of marine area and 92 km2 of terrestrial area,   with 107km coastline (Akça et al. 2012). SEPA   consists of three villages, Kapaklı, Çevreli and   Üçağız, and it also includes some parts of Bayındır,   Belenli, Boğazcık, and Sahilkılınçlı. Kale-Üçağız,   Çevreli, and Kapaklı villages administratively fall   within the Demre District to the east of the SEPA.         Figure 1. Map of study area (Between İnceburun and   Çayağzı, Antalya -Turkey)      2.2 Climate   Meteorological data were obtained from Kaş and   Kale-Demre Meteorological stations (DMİ 2015).   According to Kaş Meteorological stations data, the   annual average rainfall is 64,5 mm, the most rainy   month is January (43,9 mm) and the average   temperature is 20 °C, January is the coldest month,   with temperatures averaging 12.6 °C, August is the   hottest month, with  temperatures averaging 28.6   °C in Kaş. According to Kale-Demre Meteorological   stations data, the annual average rainfall is 64.5   mm, the most rainy month is December and the   average temperature is 18.8 °C, January is the   coldest month, with temperatures averaging 10.1      A Contribution to the Flora of the Region Between İnceburun (Kaş) and Çayağzı (Demre) (Antalya-Turkey), Çetin and Güner   770      °C, August is the hottest month, with    temperatures averaging 28.1 °C in Demre (Figure   2).     Figure 2. Thebioclimaticdiagram of Kaş and the Kale-  Demre      2.3 Field survey   Twelve field trips were made to study area at   different times of the year 2018-2019. The   collected plant species were pressed and dried   according to herbarium procedures and stored   after plant identification. The Flora of Turkey and   East Aegean Islands (Davis 1965-1985, Davis et al.   1988, Güner et al. 2000), Flora of Cyprus (Meikle   1977, 1985) and Flora of Europea (Tutin et al.   1964–1980) were used for the plant identification.   The author citations for species name follow   Brummitt and Powell (1992) and as updated   database of the Internatonal Plant Names Index   (IPNI). The names of taxa are arranged according to   the Turkey Plant List (VascularPlants). Family,   genus and taxa names are given in an alphabetical   order on the floristic list.       3. Results and Discussion   3.1 Floristic Results   During this project, 369 plant taxa belonging to 245   genera and 66 families were collected, observed,   and photographed in the study area. The literature   survey revealed that 272 taxa were previously   recorded from the Kaş-Kekova SEPA (IntKyn. 1).   According to our field studies, examination of   herbarium (GAZI) and screening of literature (only   based on previous studies and were not examined   by us), the total number reached 414 plant taxa   belonging to 266 genera and 66 families. The   number of endemic and rare plants found in the   research area is 28 (Figure 3). Additions to the flora   of the area, either from new records generated in   the field study, or from recent literature, are   reported in Appendix 1.        Figure 3. Endemic plants distributed in study area. a-   Crocus cancellatus subsp. lycius, b- Anthemis rosea   subsp. carnea, c- Campanula aktascii, d- Stachys   bombycine      The richest families in terms of plant genus were   identified as Asteraceae (12.26%; 32 genera) and   Fabaceae (9.19%; 24 genera), Poaceae (7.66%; 20   genera), Lamiaceae (7.27%; 19 genera), Apiaceae   (5.74%; 15 genera), Brassicaceae (5.36%; 14   genera), Caryophyllaceae (3.06%; 8 genera),   Boraginaceae (3.06%; 8 genera), Asparagaceae   (2.63%; 7 genera), Orchidaceae (1.91%; 5 genera)   respectively (Figure 4 ).     Figure 4. The largest 10 families based on the genus   number in the study area   The family represented by the highest number of   taxa was Fabaceae (49 taxa), followed by   Asteraceae (48 taxa), Lamiaceae (32 taxa), Poaceae   (23 taxa), Apiaceae (18 taxa), Caryophyllaceae (15   taxa), Brassicaceae (14 taxa), Orchidaceae (14   taxa), Boraginaceae (12 taxa), and Plantaginaceae   (12 taxa) (Figure 5).

Mediterranean elements regarded   as first with 50.43%, followed by Irano-Turanian   elements (1.58%) and Euro-Siberian elements   (1.12%). 46.87% of the taxa aremulti-regional, or of   unknown phytogeographic region (Figure 6).        Figure 6. Phytogeographic distribution of taxa in studied   area      3.2 Conservation status   Taxa collected in the field works have been   evaluated with conservation and risk status.   According to National Red Lists based on criteria   and categories of the IUCN (Int Kyn. 2), one taxon is   Critically endangered (Campanula aktascii), two   taxa are endangered (Campanula lycica, Ophrys   lycia), eleven taxa are vulnerable (Aristolochia   guichardii, Arenaria luschanii, Arenaria pamphylica,   Silene delicatula, Erica bocquetii, Teucrium   montbretii Benth. subsp. pamphylicum, Galium   pseudocapitatum, Limonium effusum, Narcissus   serotinus, Biarum pyrami, Barlia robertiana), seven   taxa are conservation dependent (Anthemis rosea   subsp. carnea, Alkanna macrosiphon, Medicago   carica, Quercus aucheri, Ballota glandulosissima,   Sideritis albiflora, Allium sandrasicum), four taxa   are of least concern (Bufonia calyculata, Scutellaria   brevibracteata subsp. brevibracteata, Rosularia   globulariifolia, Galium brevifolium subsp.   brevifolium), three taxa are near threatened (Ajuga   bombycina, Stachys bombycina,  Crocus cancellatus   subsp. lycius), of these, Ophrys argolica H.Fleischm.   is assessed as VU at a global level. Furthermore,   three taxa are included in the Appendix of the Bern   Convention, and 16 taxa are included in   Appendices II of CITES. More specifically, Ophrys   argolica and Ophrys lycia Renz&Taubenheim are   included in the BERN and CITES Convention.   Anacamptis pyramidalis (L.) Rich., Barlia robertiana   (Loisel.)

Plants protected by CITES Appendix II in study   area. a- Orchis sancta, b- Orchis papilionacea, c- Orchis   anatolica, d- Ophrys holoserica      3.3 Vegetation of Study Area   Maquis, phrygana, forest, rocky, halophytic and   sand dune are the main vegetation types in the   study area (Figure 8). Maquis is a natural habitat      A Contribution to the Flora of the Region Between İnceburun (Kaş) and Çayağzı (Demre) (Antalya-Turkey), Çetin and Güner   772      and composed primarily ofleathery leaved and   evergreen shrubs, semi-shrubs, and small trees   (Aksoy 2006). Maquis elements have a deep root   system, allowing them to occur even in areas with   thin soil cover or stony-rock areas (Atalay and Efe   2010). Maquis species are widespread in the area,   and its dominant species are Quercus aucheri Jaub.   &Spach, Olea europaeaL., Arbutus andrachne L.,   Pistacia terebinthus L., and Phillyrea latifolia L.         Figure 8. General view of study area a-Okçuöldüğü, b-  Çevreli, c-Kale, d- Çayağzı   Pinus brutia Ten. is one of the important forest   trees of the Mediterranean region, reaching its   greatest distribution in southern Turkey (Gezer   1986). Pinus brutia forests spread on restricted   areas in the southern slopes of Kapaklı, northern   slopes of Kekova island, and between Kapaklı and   Çevreli villages. In some parts of the study area,   maquis and P. brutia forests are also found   together.   Phrygana (garrigue) species are common in the   areas where shrubs were destroyed. They have   needles and deep roots, and they require less   humidity to survive. Phrygana species have small,   thick, and leathery leaves and can resist hot and   dry climate (Atalay 1983, Efe and Greenwood 2007,   İlseven 2017). Sarcopoterium spinosum (L.) Spach,   Genista acanthoclada DC., and Euphorbia   acanthothamnos Heldr. & Sart. ex Boiss. are frigana   species that commonly occur in the study area. The   northwestern regions of Çevreli village, eastern   region of Kale village, region between Sahilkılıçlı   and Çevreli, and coastal low-lands of Kekova and   Akvaryum islands are the areas where phrygana is   widely seen.    In several coastal localities, a number of shallow   areas fill up with water during the winter, forming   muddy, saline marshlands. As the brackish water   evaporates in the summer, the salinity dramatically   increases, and some marshlands may even dry up,   leaving behind a pool rich in mud and salt. There is   a saline area such as this one in the Alan region.   Salicornia perennans Wild., Halocnemum   strobilaceum (Pall.) M.Bieb. and Halimione   portulacoides (L.) Aellen are seen in this area.   As a result of the geological formation of the   region, the coasts in the study area are mainly   characterized by rocky shores and cliffs that can   sharply rise to slopes that eventually reach 550 m   altitude (Demir 2011). Vegetated sea cliffs of the   coast contain Ptilostemon chamaepeuce (L.) Less.,   Inula heterolepis Boiss., and Crithmum maritimum   L. vegetated calcareous inland cliffs present great   regional diversity, with many endemic plant   species, such as Teucrium montbretii Benth. subsp.   pamphylicum P.H.Davis, Ballota glandulosissima   Hub-Mor. &Patzak, and Erica bocquetii (Peşmen)   P.F.Stevens. Ferula tingitana L. is also found in this   habitat.    The olive tree (Olea europaea L. subsp. europaea)   is the most symbolic species in the Mediterranean   Basin due to its ecological, economic, and cultural   importance (Anestiadou et al. 2017). The culture of   olives and olive oil is important for the whole   Mediterranean Basin, and olive oil production has   been undertaken for many years in the   Mediterranean region of Turkey. Pomegranates,   grapes, figs, almonds, and olives were discovered   in a sunken ship speculated to belong to the Early   Bronze Age period, found in Uluburun, in the   vicinity of Kaş-Antalya (Efe et al. 2011). Also, the   existence of candidate monumental olive trees in   the region is evidence that olive has been   cultivated for thousands of years in the study area.   There are at least five candidate monumental olive   trees in Ucağız and Sahilkılınçlı villages.    The most beautiful forest of Boz pırnal oak   (Quercus aucheri), which is endemic to the Eastern   Mediterranean, grows in the study area. Quercus   aucheri was recorded for C1, C2 and C3 squares,   which are in the southwest part of Turkey. In this   area, the species has a scattered expansion due to      A Contribution to the Flora of the Region Between İnceburun (Kaş) and Çayağzı (Demre) (Antalya-Turkey), Çetin and Güner   773      fragmentation of its area (Özel 2003). The   Mediterranean Oaks Networks Reports pointed out   that Q. aucheri trees have been degraded by local   people in southwest Anatolia in different ways,   such as cutting, overgrazing, acorn collecting, etc.,   suggesting that the distribution area should be   protected. Conservation of Q. aucheri in the   natural habitat is very important to protect genetic   resources and biodiversity (Özel 2003).   The study area covers part of the distribution area   of the Ophrys lycia, which is endemic to Kaş   (Antalya) and is only known from its type locality.   Orchidaceae is a large family consisting of over   1000 genera; most orchid genera contain one or   more threatened or endangered species. Many   terrestrial orchids are rare, with specialized habitat   requirements, making them particularly susceptible   to habitat fragmentation and modification. They   have often been used as flagship species in   conservation initiatives because of their   uniqueness and rarity and, additionally, are often   touted as important early warning bioindicators for   ecosystem health given their sensitivity to   environmental degradation (Wang et al. 2015).Like   other endangered orchid species, O. lycia and its   habitat are under threat. The species was   previously classified as endangered (Ekim et al.   2000), then proposed to be critically endangered   (CR) by Deniz (2013). In order to protect the   population and ensure the survival of this species,   a conservation and research project, Ophrys lycia   (Lycian Kaş Orchid) Conservation Project, was   created by Deniz et al. (2016).    The Mediterranean flora of West Anatolia shows   many affinities with that of the East Aegean islands   and even with Greek mainland (Ekim and Güner   2000). Ricotia carnosula Boiss. &Heldr., Veronica   stamatiadae M.A.Fisch. &Greuter, Campanula   podocarpa Boiss., Campanula hagielia Boiss.,   Phlomis lycia D.Don, Fritillaria elwesii Boiss., and   Alkanna tubulosa Boiss. are endemic to the Eastern   Mediterranean, and they are distributed in the east   Aegean Islands and western Anatolia.   According to information was obtained from local   people, leaves and flowers of Origanum onites and   leaves of Salvia fruticosa and Laurus nobilis are   consumed as spices, teas and herbal drugs.

For the overlay design scenarios on existing asphalt surface layers, it was found that, overlay   thickness decreases, as existing asphalt surface layer thickness increases, and calculated concrete   overlay thicknesses were higher than calculated asphalt overlay thicknesses for the same existing   asphalt surface layer thicknesses. On the other hand, for the overlay design scenarios on existing   concrete surface layers, both asphalt and concrete overlay thicknesses were found to be very similar to   each other. Based on FAARFIELD-calculated overlay thicknesses, an economic analysis was carried out   to find out the most economic overlay design options for a variety of design scenarios. Although for   some overlay cases concrete overlay design thicknesses were found to be higher than asphalt overlay   design thickness, cost of concrete overlays was found to be less than that of asphalt overlays. This is   because unit cost for concrete materials is less than that for asphalt materials. Incorporating a state-of-  the-art mechanistic-empirical overlay design for airfield overlay pavements as well as considering local   cost in the economic analysis to determine which type of overlay would be a more suitable option for   a variety of pavement design cases would be very beneficial to Turkish airfield pavement design   practices.

Introduction   Overlays are one of the cost effective and efficient   pavement rehabilitation options because   reconstruction of airfield pavements requires   greater construction times (and so a greater closure   time of an airport) and more money compared to   overlays. Increasing closure time of a runway in a   busy airport negatively affects both user and agency   costs. Therefore, overlays, adding another layer(s)   of pavement on available surface layer would be a   good alternative to reconstruction. Some of the   reasons why airfield pavements may need   rehabilitation are as follows (FAA 2016):    • To improve functional and structural conditions   of airfield pavements   • To eliminate material-related distresses and   distresses related to overloading   • To increase overall structural capacity of   pavement to enable heavier aircraft land on   them or extend number of operations on them   Rehabilitation strategies are an important part of   pavement management systems (Dong and Huang   2012, Huang 2003). An effective and efficient   pavement management system should consider all   reconstruction, maintenance and rehabilitation   options together and manage them well in order to   keep all pavement sections in a road network in an   acceptable condition (Yu and Lu 2012, Morova vd.   2016). Especially for the developed countries where   road network is quite well-distributed nationwide,   keeping whole road network in both structurally and   functionally good condition requires spending a   significant portion of total budget for roads on   pavement rehabilitation and maintenance   compared to building new pavements. Turkey is one   of the developing countries where many new road   sections are built. However, if the newly built road   sections are not well maintained and rehabilitated,   these road sections might deteriorate fast, so   bringing deteriorated road sections in good   condition might require greater amount of money   compared to the one needed to timely maintain and   rehabilitate them (Şengün vd. 2020).   Design and construction of overlays require many   considerations such as: Transition and drainage   between existing layer and overlays should be   considered and condition of the existing pavement   should be assessed and improved, if needed.   Namely, distressed asphalt layers could be milled to   some extent to remove severely deteriorated   portion of the asphalt layers or severely cracked   slabs could be partially or fully repaired to ensure   that existing layers have enough structural capacity.   If an existing pavement section has poor subsurface   drainage; then its drainage condition should be   improved before overlay is applied.    Overlays are broadly categorized into two groups:   asphalt and concrete overlays. Both asphalt and   concrete overlays have been widely used for   highway pavements for quite long time but not   much in airfield pavements (Harrington and Fick   2014).    Concrete overlays are also broadly separated as   bonded and unbonded concrete overlays. Bonded   concrete overlays are used as preventative   maintenance or minor rehabilitation options and   mostly used on highway pavements. They are   required to be overlaid on an existing pavement   layer with good to fair structural condition. They are   designed to add some structural capacity to the   existing surface. Bonded concrete overlays are   relatively thin (2–6 in. [50–150 mm]) compared to   unbonded concrete overlays. Design philosophy in   bonded concrete overlays is that they should be   bonded to the  existing surface well that both   overlays and existing surface layers behave as a one   monolithic structure. On the other hand, unbonded   concrete overlays are applied on an existing surface   with moderate or severe distresses, where existing   surface layer is treated as a stable base, so existing   surface layer is not counted as a structural surface   element in the overlay design. Unbonded concrete   overlays are used as minor or major rehabilitation   options (Harrington and Fick 2014, Bhattacharya et   al. 2017, Vandenbossche and Fagerness 2002). Both   bonded and unbonded concrete overlays have   subcategories  depending on the type of existing   surface layer (Figure 1).      Comparative Design and Economic Analysis of Asphalt and Concrete Overlays for Airfield Pavements, Kaya   875         Figure 1. Types of concrete overlays (Harrington and Fick 2014)   Asphalt overlays could also be applied on both   existing concrete and asphalt surface layers. They   can be used for preservation or structural purposes.   Preservation overlays are used to preserve existing   surface in good condition whereas structural   overlays are used to add some structural capacity to   the existing surface layer. Therefore, structural   asphalt overlays are mostly thicker than   preservation asphalt overlays. In the design and   construction of asphalt overlays, several parameters   should be considered such as:  whether a pre-  overlay repair is needed; how reflection cracking   coming from existing surface layer should be   controlled; how future traffic will change; and   whether an improvement in sub-drainage is needed   etc. (SCAPA 2016).   Some mechanistic and mechanistic-empirical   pavement design methodologies have been   developed for both concrete and asphalt overlays,   mostly for highway pavement applications. Some of   these design methodologies developed for highway   overlay pavement applications are summarized in   Table 1. Detailed information on each design   methodology can be found in Harrington and Fick   (2014). As can be seen in Table 1, some of these   design methodologies are specifically developed for   either asphalt or concrete overlays whereas some of   them are developed for both overlay types.   Historically, Asphalt Institute’s design method   (Asphalt Institute 1983) and The American   Association of State Highway and Transportation   Officials (AASHTO)’s 1993 guide for design of   pavement structures (AASHTO 1993) have been   widely used in the design of asphalt overlays   whereas AASHTO 1993 guide for design of   pavement structures (AASHTO 1993) has been   widely used in the design of concrete overlays.   However, all these three methodologies were based   on empirical relations and equations. To advance   the design methodologies and carry out the overlay   design based on mechanistic relations, based on   mechanics of materials principals, some   mechanistic-empirical pavement design   methodologies have been developed (Table 1).   Although some design methodologies and   associated design software have been developed for   highway overlay pavements, there has been not   much study regarding the overlay design for airfield   pavements. Some empirical equations and graphs   have been developed by International Civil Aviation   Organization (ICAO) for overlay designs (ICAO    1983). These empirical equations have also been   used in Turkey for overlay designs (DLH 2007).

The   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has   developed a mechanistic-empirical based overlay   pavement design methodology where it considers   all mechanical loads coming from a set of aircraft   projected to land on overlaid pavements and   calculating all fatigue damage coming from these   mechanical loads in order to do overlay thickness   design. Its design methodology has been   incorporated into its design software, FAA Rigid and   Flexible Iterative Elastic Layered Design   (FAARFIELD). Latest version of FAARFIELD is version   1.42, where its aircraft library includes a wide-range   of aircraft including newly emerging wide-body   aircraft (Int Kyn. 4).   In this study, FAARFIELD design methodology for   overlays will be explained in great detail. Design   examples using FAARFIELD version 1.42 for both   concrete and asphalt overlays will be presented, and   the results of these examples will be compared.   Based on FAARFIELD-calculated overlay thicknesses,   an economic analysis will be carried out based on   unit costs for both concrete and asphalt overlays   obtained from 2019 Construction and Installation   Unit Prices Book of Republic of Turkey, the Ministry   of Environment and Urbanism (CSB 2019), to find   out the most economic overlay design options for a   variety of design scenarios. Incorporating a state-of-  the-art mechanistic-empirical overlay design   methodology for airfield overlay pavements as well   as considering local cost in the economic analysis to   determine which type of overlay would be a more   suitable option for a variety of pavement design   scenarios would be very beneficial to Turkish airfield   pavement design practices. This study also   highlights that rehabilitation options should also be   fully considered as an alternative to reconstruction   as they are mostly cheaper and faster alternatives   compared to reconstruction.   2. FAARFIELD Overlay Design    FAARFIELD allows users to design four types of   overlays: asphalt overlays on existing asphalt or   concrete surfaces and concrete overlays on existing   asphalt or concrete surfaces. In terms of   mechanistic models, FAARFIELD uses a layered   elastic analysis for asphalt overlays and three-  dimensional finite element analysis (3D-FE) for   concrete overlays. Design life for overlays could be   selected by the users with a range between 1 year   and 50 years, 20 years being the default value (FAA   2016).    2.1 Design comparisons of asphalt and concrete   overlays on existing asphalt surfaces   FAARFIELD requires a minimum asphalt overlay   thickness of 2 inches (50 mm) for nonstructural   asphalt overlays and 3 inches (75 mm) for structural   asphalt overlays on existing asphalt surface layers.   Thickness design for asphalt overlays on existing   asphalt surfaces is carried out by FAARFIELD as   follows: FAARFIELD first assigns a trial asphalt      Comparative Design and Economic Analysis of Asphalt and Concrete Overlays for Airfield Pavements, Kaya   877      overlay thickness on an existing pavement structure   and revises this assigned thickness as a result of an   iteration process until a cumulative damage factor,   ratio between number of applied load repetitions   coming from design airplane mix and number of   allowable load repetitions to failure, reaches the   value of “1”. Calculated asphalt overlay thickness as   a result of this iteration process is determined as   design asphalt overlay thickness, given that   calculated thickness values are higher than   minimum thicknesses mentioned above (FAA 2016).   As part of this iteration process, mechanical loads   coming from an aircraft mix are applied on overlays   with the trial asphalt overlay thickness and   pavement responses are calculated in critical   pavement response locations using the mechanistic   models. Then, the calculated pavement responses   are input into the fatigue damage model to   determine cumulative damage caused by the   aircraft mix. If the ratio between the calculated   cumulative damage and the allowable damage is not   equal to “1”, the trial asphalt overlay thickness is   changed and the whole iterative process is repeated   until the ratio reaches “1”.   FAARFIELD also designs an unbonded concrete   overlay on an existing asphalt surface by treating   the existing asphalt surface layer as a stabilized base   layer and optimizing unbonded concrete overlay   thickness. Similar to asphalt overlays, FAARFIELD   first assigns a trial unbonded concrete overlay   thickness and revises this thickness based on an   iteration process until a CDF value of “1” is reached.   Minimum allowable unbonded concrete overlay on   an existing asphalt surface layer in FAARFIELD is 6   inches (150 mm).   Screenshot examples of FAARFIELD runs can be seen   in Figure 2 for (a) an asphalt and (b) an unbonded   concrete overlay on existing asphalt surfaces. As can   be seen in Figure 2, all pavement structure could be   customized and corresponding input parameters for   each pavement layer could be entered and revised.   Design life could also be input by the user. Aircraft   mix that will be used in the analysis, annual   departures and percent annual growth for each   aircraft in the mix could be customized as well,   which will be discussed later in this paper. Once all   inputs are entered, “Design Structure” button is   clicked to initiate the iteration process. FAARFIELD   revises the overlay thickness until a CDF value of “1”   is reached (Figure 2).      (a)      (b)   Figure 2. Screenshot examples of FAARFIELD runs for (a)   an asphalt and (b) an unbonded concrete overlays on   existing asphalt surfaces   In this study, FAARFIELD runs will be carried out   based on mechanical loads coming from a mix of   aircraft shown in Table 2. These aircraft mix was   selected in the runs because they are the four most   common aircraft in Turkish Airline’s fleet as of 2019   (Int Kyn. 5). Corresponding gross weights, assumed   annual departures and percent annual growth of   traffic are also presented in Table 2. B777-300 ER is   the heaviest aircraft, a wide-body aircraft, in its   fleet. Another wide body aircraft in its fleet is A330-  200 aircraft, while other two aircraft, B737-800 and   A321-200, are categorized as narrow-body aircraft.      Comparative Design and Economic Analysis of Asphalt and Concrete Overlays for Airfield Pavements, Kaya   878      Annual departures of each aircraft were selected   proportionally to their numbers in Turkish Airline’s   fleet (Int Kyn. 5).

On   top of this granular base, an existing asphalt surface    layer is laid. Overlays are applied on top of the   existing asphalt surface layer. Existing asphalt   surface layer thickness was varied and both asphalt   and concrete overlay thicknesses are calculated for   each existing asphalt surface layer thickness (Table   3). In terms of design life, 20 years was assumed   (Figure 2). As can be seen in Table 3, in both asphalt   and concrete overlay designs, overlay thickness   decreases, as existing asphalt surface layer   thickness increases. Also, calculated concrete   overlay thicknesses were found to be higher than   calculated asphalt overlay thicknesses for the same   existing asphalt surface layer thicknesses (Table 3).   Table 3.

Structural condition of the   existing concrete surface layer is estimated in terms   of structural condition index (SCI), a similar   parameter to pavement condition index but only   considering structural failures, 100 being no visible   structural cracks and 0 being total failure (FAA   2016). An SCI value of 80 means that 20% of the   structural capacity of the existing concrete   pavement is lost during its previous use. In this   study, a SCI value of 80 will be used to characterize   structural condition of the existing concrete surface   layer and both asphalt and unbonded concrete   overlays will be placed on it. Similar to overlays on   existing asphalt surface layer cases, a subgrade with   a k value, modulus of subgrade reaction, of 46.8   Mega-newton (MN) per cubic meter, an equivalent   number to a CBR value of 10%, on top of which, a P-  209 granular crushed aggregate base with 152.4 mm   thickness will be used (Figure 3). Figure 3 shows   examples of FAARFIELD runs for asphalt and   concrete overlays on existing concrete surface   layers. In terms of mechanical load, the same   aircraft mix used in overlay cases on existing asphalt   surface layers (Table 2) are used. Minimum   allowable unbonded concrete overlay on existing   concrete layer thickness in FAARFIELD is 6 inches   (150 mm). In FAARFIELD runs, a design life of 20   years was used, the same as overlay cases on   existing asphalt surface layers.   Table 4 shows comparisons of FAARFIELD-calculated   asphalt and concrete overlays on a existing concrete   surface layers with a variety of thicknesses. As can   be seen in Table 4, as existing concrete surface layer   thickness increases, both asphalt and concrete   overlay thicknesses decrease. Different than   overlays on existing asphalt surface layer cases,   both asphalt and concrete overlay thicknesses on   existing concrete surface layers were found to be   very similar to each other, especially for 350 and 400   mm existing concrete surface layer thickness cases.   Moreover, as can be seen in Table 4, the rate of      Comparative Design and Economic Analysis of Asphalt and Concrete Overlays for Airfield Pavements, Kaya   879      decrease in overlay thickness was found to be   higher for asphalt overlays than for concrete   overlays as existing concrete surface layer thickness   increases.

However,   existing concrete surface layer could not be milled   but rather cracked and fault on its surface could be   treated.   3. Economic Analysis of Overlay Designs   An economic analysis of various overlay design   options based on FAARFIELD design calculations   presented in the previous chapters of this paper will   be carried out. In the economic analysis, only initial   cost of overlays, or construction cost, is considered;   while maintenance cost of ovarlays is not   considered. In terms of construction cost, a unit   price considering material, equipment, labor and   transportation costs for both concrete and asphalt   overlays, obtained from 2019 Construction and   Installation Unit Prices Book of Republic of Turkey,   the Ministry of Environment and Urbanism (CSB   2019), is used. As stated in the previous chapters of   this papers, in the comparison of overlay design   thicknesses, the same existing pavement   configuration (the same subgrade material, the   same granular base and existing surface layer   materials and thicknesses) was used for the same   overlay cases, only overlay thicknesses were   optimized. Therefore, cost of existing surface layers   was the same for both concrete and asphalt overlay   cases. That is why, only both asphalt and concrete   overlay costs for the same existing pavement type   and configuration were compared in the economic   analysis.   • Unit asphalt overlay cost including materials,   transportation (up to 10 km distance),   construction and labor is calculated as   approximately 180.79 Turkish Lira (TL)/ton (CSB   2019). Considering the density asphalt as 2.4   ton/m3, 180.79 Turkish Lira (TL)/ton can be   converted into 433.90 TL/m3.   • Unit concrete overlay cost including materials,   transportation (up to 10 km distance),      Comparative Design and Economic Analysis of Asphalt and Concrete Overlays for Airfield Pavements, Kaya   880      construction, labor, concrete curing and jointing   is calculated as approximately 287.81 TL/m3   (CSB 2019).   Total overlay cost comparisons will be based on a   runway with a width of 60 m. and a length of 1,000   m. Figure 4 shows comparisons of estimated   construction costs for both asphalt and concrete   overlays on existing asphalt (Figure 4a) and concrete   (Figure 4b) surface layers with various thicknesses.   As can be seen in Figure 4a, construction cost of   asphalt overlay was slightly higher than the one of   concrete overlay on an existing asphalt surface layer   with a 40 mm thickness, although FAARFIELD-  calculated concrete overlay thickness was higher   than asphalt overlay thickness. This is because, unit   cost of concrete overlay for the same thickness is   lower than the unit cost of asphalt overlay.   However, after the existing asphalt surface layer   thickness of 50 mm, construction cost of concrete   overlay exceeds the construction cost of asphalt   overlay. This is because, the rate of decrease in   overlay thickness was found to be higher for asphalt   overlays than for concrete overlays as existing   concrete surface layer thickness increases (Table 3).    Cost of asphalt overlays on existing concrete surface   layers were calculated to be significantly higher than   the cost of concrete overlays on existing concrete   surface layers for the existing concrete surface layer   thickness of 350 mm. The cost difference between   asphalt and concrete overlays on existing concrete   surface layer decreases as existing concrete surface   layer thickness increases. This is because   FAARFIELD-calculated asphalt and concrete overlay   thicknesses were similar for the existing concrete   surface layer thickness of 350- and 400-mm cases   (Table 4) and unit cost of concrete overlay was less   than the unit cost of asphalt overlay.

Conclusions and Discussion   In this study, FAA’s state-of-the-art mechanistic-  empirical based FAARFIELD design methodology for   overlays was explained in great detail. Then, design   examples using FAARFIELD version 1.42. for both   concrete and asphalt overlays were presented, and   the results of these examples were compared. In   these design examples, the four most common   aircraft in Turkish Airline’s fleet as of 2019 were   used as mechanical loads. For the overlay design   scenarios on existing asphalt surface layers, it was   found that, overlay thickness decreases, as existing   asphalt surface layer thickness increases. It was also   found for the overlay design scenarios on existing   asphalt surface layer that, calculated concrete   overlay thicknesses were higher than calculated   asphalt overlay thicknesses for the same existing   asphalt thicknesses. On the other hand, for the   overlay design scenarios on existing concrete   surface layers, both asphalt and concrete overlay   0  2  4  6  8  10  40 60 80 100 120  T o  ta l O  ve rl  a y   C o  st  (  M il  li o  n    T L)  Existing Asphalt Layer Thickness (mm)  Asphalt Overlay Concrete Overlay  0  2  4  6  8  10  350 375 400 425 450 T  o ta  l O ve  rl a  y  C  o st   ( M  il li  o n    T  L) Existing Concrete Layer Thickness (mm)  Asphalt Overlay Concrete Overlay     Comparative Design and Economic Analysis of Asphalt and Concrete Overlays for Airfield Pavements, Kaya   881      thicknesses were found to be very similar to each   other especially for 350 and 400 mm existing   concrete surface layer thickness cases.    Based on FAARFIELD-calculated overlay thicknesses,   an economic analysis was carried out based on unit   costs for both concrete and asphalt overlays   obtained from 2019 Construction and Installation   Unit Prices Book of Republic of Turkey, the Ministry   of Environment and Urbanism, to find out the most   economic overlay design options for a variety of   design scenarios. It was found that construction cost   of asphalt overlay was slightly higher than the one   of concrete overlay on an existing asphalt surface   layer with 40 mm thickness, although FAARFIELD-  calculated concrete overlay thickness was higher   than asphalt overlay thickness. On the other hand,   cost of asphalt overlays on existing concrete surface   layers were calculated to be significantly higher than   the cost of concrete overlays on existing concrete   surface  layers for the existing concrete surface layer   thickness of 350 mm. This result can be explained by   the fact that unit cost of concrete overlay for the   same thickness is lower than the unit cost of asphalt   overlay.   Incorporating a state-of-the-art mechanistic-  empirical overlay design for airfield overlay   pavements as well as considering local cost in the   economic analysis to determine which type of   overlay would be a more suitable option for a   variety of overlay design cases would be very   beneficial to Turkish airfield pavement design   practices. This study also highlights that   rehabilitation options should also be fully   considered as an alternative to reconstruction as   they are mostly cheaper and faster alternatives   compared to reconstruction. It should be noted that   Turkey is one of the leading cement producers and   importers in the World. On the other hand, Turkey   is an oil exporter country, where the most expensive   component of asphalt, asphalt binder, is a   byproduct of. That is why, unit material cost of   concrete is significantly less than that of asphalt in   Turkey. From the economic analysis perspective,   concrete overlays made out of locally produced   cement would be a cost-effective rehabilitation   option along with asphalt overlays.   5.

Introduction   The spiny tailed lizard, Darevskia rudis (Bedriaga,   1886), is distributed central and northern coastal   region of Anatolia, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Russia   and Azerbaijan, therefore it is one of the   representative faunal elements of the Black Sea   region of Anatolian Peninsula (Arribas et al. 2013).   Due to its relatively wide range distribution, it can   be a good model for different aspects of   evolutionary studies, such as sexual dimorphism.   The sexual dimorphism phenomenon has been   relatively well studied in lacertid lizards especially   for the last two decades (Herrel et al. 1999; Heidari   et al. 2012; Oraie et al. 2013; Karamiani et al. 2015).   This phenomenon in lizards is thought to have   serious effects on behavior, size and shape   characteristics (Carothers 1984). According to   Rensch’s rule, males display higher phenotypic                  Afyon Kocatepe Üniversitesi Fen ve Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi    Afyon Kocatepe University Journal of Science and  Engineering       Sexual Dimorphism In Spiny - tailed Lizard, Darevskia rudis (Bedriaga, 1886) (Sauria: Lacertidae), from Northeastern…, Şahin et al.          552   plasticity in body size than females (Fairbairn 1997).   In addition to that, males generally have larger head   size and longer tail lengths in lizards (Verwaijen et   al. 2002). Therefore, in present study, we would like   to investigate whether D. rudis displays sexual   dimorphism in different characters, that has not   been studied before for this species.      2. Materials and methods   Field surveys were carried out in the Black Sea   region of Anatolian Peninsula between 2000 and   2003. A total of 317 specimens (166 ♂♂ and 151 ♀♀)   were collected and they were deposited in the   Fauna and Flora Research and Application Centre of   Dokuz Eylül University (Buca-İzmir). The specimens   were examined based on 11 morphometric and 30   meristic characters. The presence/absence of a   hemipenis retracted in the hemipenial sack at the   base of the tail were used to assess specimen’s sex   (Başoğlu and Baran. 1977). Morphometric   characters are as follows: Pileus length (PL), Pileus   width (PW), Head length (The following metric   dimensions were taken using dial calipers with   accuracy to the nearest 0.01 mm: Snout-vent length   (SVL): from tip of snout to anal cleft. Tail length (TL):   from anal cleft to tip of tail. Pileus width (PW): at   widest point between parietal plates. Pileus length   (PL): tip of snout to posterior margins of parietals.   Head width (HW): at widest point of head. Head   length (HL): tip of snout to posterior margin of ear   opening. Furthermore, morphometric ratios and   indexes were calculated, Snout-vent/Tail length   (SVL/Ta), Tail length/Total length (Ta/T), Pileus   index (PI) [(PL / PW)] and Head index (HI) [(HL /   HW)].   Meristic scalation characters considered here   consisted of the following counts: Supraciliar   granules (left-right) (ScgL-ScgR), Supraciliar plates   (left-right) (ScL-ScR), Supralabial plates (left-right)   (SuplL-SupR), Sublabial plates (left-right) (SublL-  SublR), transversal series of gular scales between   inframaxillar symphysis and collar (MG), Collaria (C),   Supratemporal scales (ST), temporal scales 1   (transversal rows of temporal scales between   masseteric and tympanic) (left-right) (MaTyL-  MaTyL), temporal scales 2 (longitudinal rows of   temporal scales between supratemporal and   masseteric) (left-right) (MasSupL-MasSupL),   Postemporal plates (left-right) (PostTL-PostTR),   Ventral plates (transversal and longitudinal)   (VenLeng and VenWid), dorsals attached ventrals at   mid-trunk (VenattDor), Preanals 1 (number of   preanals located anterior of anal plate) (Pra1),   Preanals 2 (number of preanals surrounding anal   plate) (Pra2), Femoral pores (left-right) (FPL-FPR),   longitudinal rows of scales on ventral surface of   thigh between the femoral pores and the outer row   of enlarged scales (left-right) (FPopL-FPopR),   Subdigital lamellae in the 4th toe (left-right) (SDLL-  SDLR), Tibial scales (scales lying on dorsal surface of   ankle between the large scales (TS) and transversal   series of dorsal scales at the midtrunk (Dor).   Meristic characters were counted under a   stereomicroscope.   Statistical analyses were performed using R   Software version 3.6.1 (R. Core Team 2019). The   significance level for all statistical tests was set at p   < 0.05. In the first part of analysis, the whole raw   data was examined in Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and   it was found that morphological characters were not   normally distributed. After that, these characters   were logarithmically transformed. To uncover   dispersal patterns among all characters, descriptive   statistical parameters including minimum,   maximum, mean, standard deviation, ANOVA were   established for each sex separately in Table 1.   Moreover, the homogeneity of variances was also   tested to filter the best reflected parameters in   sexual dimorphism, as the threshold level is 0.1   (Table 1). Finally, we performed a principal   component analysis (PCA) to evaluate the   contribution of statistically significant characters in   the patterns of sexual dimorphism (Table 2).

Ordination of the individual males and females of Darevskia rudis in the first two principle components.      Comparative studies on sexual dimorphism (SD)   should generally include body size as a potential   determinant (Fairbairn et al. 2007) and reproductive   output is related with morphological features in   reptiles (Heidari et al. 2012; Dehghani et al. 2014;   Karamiani et al. 2015). Especially combat success is   generally positively correlated with larger body size   (Olsson 1992; Heidari et al. 2012). According to   Rensch’s rule, sexual size dimorphism (SSD)   characteristically increase with size when males are   the larger sex (Cox et al. 2003; Fairbairn et al. 2007;   Karamiani et al. 2013).    According to our data, it was obvious that males of   Darevskia rudis, showed longer SVL and TL than   females even in relatively less individual   comparisons. Besides, it is universal that male   lacertids have a relatively larger head size than   females (HL, HW, PL and PW) (Huang 1998; Molina-  Borja et al. 2010; Dehghani et al. 2014; Karamiani et   al. 2015). Males with larger heads could produce   greater bite force as ammunition in combat (Lappin   and Husak 2005). Furthermore, due to noteworthy   reproductive success, males tend to have more   spacious and better space. That’s why females have   a tendency to prefer larger sized males (Chang and   Oh 2012). This pattern is well observed in our data   with HW, HL, PW and PL are higher in D. rudis males   than females (Table 1.).   On the other hand, femoral pores and ventral scales   are also useful characters to distinguish males and   females in lacertids (Heidari et al. 2012; Dehghani et   al. 2014). Males have femoral pores with holocrine   secretion that is abundant only in the reproductive   period, that play an important role in sexual   selection because of their contribution to signaling   mechanisms (Martín and López 2006; Gabirot et al.   2008; Iraeta et al. 2011). Here, our results supported   this process as males (mean=19.59) have more   femoral pores in both legs than females   (mean=18.70), and this suggested that males are   endeavoring to discharge signaling compounds to   find an appropriate mate.   According to an overall evaluation of all these   results, we may conclude that D. rudis shows the   classic pattern of lacertid sexual dimorphism.

Abstract   Hexa [4-(4-hydroxy-phenyliminomethyl) phenoxy] cyclotriphosphazene (A1) and Hexa [4-(2- hydroxy-   phenyliminomethyl) phenoxy] cyclotriphosphazene (A2) were derived from the reactions of hexa(4-   formyl-phenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene and hexa(2-formyl-phenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene with 4-   aminophenol and 2-aminophenol. Adsorption process in an aqueous solution of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn ions   of the organophosphazenes bearing imine groups were performed depending on the initial   concentration of metal ions and time. All of the compounds adsorbed the selected metal ions in the   first 10 minutes. When the initial concentration of metal ions increases, the amount of metal ions   adsorbed of organophosphazene with imine groups increased. Although the chemical structures of the   compounds are different, the amount of adsorbed metal was about the same.

There are three   different groups of phosphazene compounds, linear   (1), ring (2) and poly (3). (Figure 1.). In the linear   phosphazenes, three side groups are bound to three   phosphorus atoms, while in the ring and poly   phosphazenes, two side groups are bound to each   phosphorus atom. These side groups can be   halogens, a wide variety of organic or   organometallic compounds (Allen, 1994).   Figure 1. Structure of phosphazene compound groups.

It is estimated that over 10,000   different ring and linear organophosphazenes have   been synthesized to date. Among these   organophosphazenes, the number of   organophosphazenes that carry groups such as   formyl, imine and oxime is quite low. New   organophosphazene derivatives of formyl and   imine, which are our study subjects, were   performed at room temperature and room   atmosphere.           Figure 2. Reaction of halophosphazene with sodium phenolates         Figure 3. Synthesis of organophosphazen from the reaction of halophosphazen with phenol in the presence of base      1.1 Reaction Mechanism of Halophosphazenes   with Phenols   The reaction of halophosphazenes and phenols is   carried out in one of two methods. In the first   method, the salt of the phenol with metallic sodium   is first prepared and then reacted with   halophosphazene. This reaction results in   organophosphazene and NaCl. The phenolate acts   as nucleophilic in the displacement.      In the second method, the reaction of halo   phosphazene with phenol takes place in the   presence of one of the bases such as carbonates of   group 1A or triethylamine. The base used is said to   serve to retain the HCl formed in the reaction. This   method is simpler than the first method. Because in   the first method must to prepare the salt of phenol.   Since the phenol salts have the ability to decompose   by air, the reaction should be carried out in an   airless environment.      1.2 Reactions of Halo Phosphazenes with Formyl-  bearing Phenols    Formyl-bearing organophosphazenes are derived   from the reactions of hexa chloro cyclo   triphosphazene with 4- hydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-      Removal of Heavy Metal Ions with Phenoxy Substituted Cyclotriphosphazene Derivatives Bearing Imine, Özer et al.         567   hydroxybenzaldehyde, sodium 4- formyl - 3-   methoxyphenate, 4 - hydroxyl - 3 -   methoxybenzaldehyde, 2 - hydroxyl – 4 -   methoxybenzaldehyde, 5 - bromo - 2 -   formylbenzaldehyde and 5- chloro - 2-   formylbenzaldehyde. Both methods were used in   these studies. All of the studies were carried out in   airless environment Both methods were used in   these studies. But second method was more used.   All of these reactions were carried out in an airless   environment.    Carriedo et al. (1996) obtained hexa (4-formyl-  phenoxy) cyclotrifosphazene in the THF solvent of 4-  hydroxybenzaldehyde and in the presence of K2CO3   in the presence of 91% of the hot reaction with   hexa-chlorobenzoyl triphosphazene (Figure 4). In   this reaction, 6 moles of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde   N3P3Cl6, 14.4 moles of K2CO3 N3P3Cl6 were used   (Cariedo et al., 1996). They obtained the same   compound at room temperature and 92% yield,   using 6.07 moles of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde N3P3Cl6   and 12.16 moles of K2CO3 N3P3Cl6 (Cil et al., 2006). In   both studies, the reaction was continued for 48   hours in the absence of air.        Figure 4  Synthesis reaction of hexa (4-formyl-phenoxy) cyclotrifosphase.        Figure 5.

Tümer et al (2008) in the presence of K2CO3 in the   acetonitrile solvent of 4-hydroxy-3-  methoxybenzaldehyde with   hexachlorocyclotrifosphazene, they obtained hexa   (4-formyl-2-methoxyphenoxy) cyclotrifosphazene in   a 74% yield from in the hot reaction at 48 hours   (Tumer et al., 2008). In this reaction, 6 moles of 4-  hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde N3P3Cl6, 21.75      Removal of Heavy Metal Ions with Phenoxy Substituted Cyclotriphosphazene Derivatives Bearing Imine, Özer et al.         568   moles of K2CO3 N3P3Cl6 were used. The reaction was   carried out in airless medium (Figure 5).   Yuan et al (2005) obtained hexa (4-formyl-phenoxy)   cyclotrifosphazen compound in 88% yield from the   reaction of hexaklorosiklotrifosfazene with sodium   4-formylphenolol in THF at 48 hours in hot (Yuan et   al., 2005). This reaction was carried out in the airless   medium (Figure 6).       Figure 6. Synthesis of hexa (4-formyl-phenoxy) cyclotriphosphazene from sodium 4-formyl-phenol.         1.3 Immin Bearing Organophosphazenes   The imines are derived from the acid-catalyzed   reaction of amines with aldehydes and ketones.   Such compounds were first introduced by Schiff, It   is also called Schiff base. Imine compounds derived   from aromatic aldehyde and aromatic amines are   more stable.     Few studies have been done on the synthesis of   imine-bearing organophosphazenes from the   reactions of formyl-bearing organophosphazen with   primary amines. In studies, hexa (4-forylphenoxy)   cyclotrifosphazen, hexa (2-formyl-phenoxy)   cyclotrifosphazen, hexa (4-bromo-2-formyl-  phenoxy) cyclotrifosphazen, hexa (4-chloro-2-  formyl-phenoxy)  cyclotrifosphazen, hexa (4-amino-  3-methyl-phenoxy) cyclotrifosphazen, 1- {2- [1,3-di   (oxytetrathehlenoxy) -3,5,5-tri (2-formyl-  phenyloxy) cyclotrifosphazen] oxyethylamino}   antraquinone and 1,3-oxytetraethyloxy) -1,3,5,5-  tetra (2-formyl-phenoxy) cyclotrifosphazen as   formyl bearing organophosphazen used (Aslan et   al., 2008, Ozturk et al., 2013).      1.4 Adsorption and Adsorption Types   The adherence of atoms, ions or molecules on a   solid surface is called adsorption. The separation of   the suspended particles from the surface is called   desorption. The rate and amount of adsorption is a   function of the adsorbing surface. For this,   substances which surface area according to the   mass is larger, preferred. If the pressure increases   during the adsorption of gases, the adsorbent may   adsorb more of the substance. The same applies to   adsorption of solutions. Adsorption of the solution;   temperature depends on the nature of the   substance to be adsorbed and the concentration in   the solution (Karaman, 2010).   The adsorption of gases and liquids (in solution) has   three successive velocity steps. The first is the   transport of adsorbed material to the outer surface   of the adsorbent as a film (film diffusion), the   second is the diffusion within the adsorptive pores   (Pore diffusion). In the last step, adsorption of   adsorbent material onto the adsorbing pore surface   occurs. Usually the last step is very fast. In the   adsorption of liquids, adsorption is caused by the   interest of the solid matter against the solute. This      Removal of Heavy Metal Ions with Phenoxy Substituted Cyclotriphosphazene Derivatives Bearing Imine, Özer et al.         569   surface phenomenon is due to the electrical   attraction of the solvent applied to the adsorbent,   the Van der Waals forces or the chemical structure.       1.5 Adsorption Types   There are three different types of adsorption   depending on the type of attraction forces between   adsorbed molecules and adsorbing surface.    1. Physical adsorption: Physical adsorption occurs   as a result of physical attraction forces between the   solid surface and the adsorbed substance   molecules. Physical adsorption; the forces that bind   adsorbed molecules to the adsorbing surface are   weak Van der Waals forces. Desorption is easier and   faster because the attraction forces are weak.   Physical adsorption is generally observed at low   temperature. It is characterized by low energy   adsorption. Physical adsorption is reversible, and   the process is very fast. As the temperature   increases, physical adsorption is generally reduced   (Berkem and Baykut, 1984).    2. Chemical adsorption: Chemical adsorption is   caused by the chemical bond between adsorbing   molecules and adsorbing surface molecules or   atoms. This type of adsorption in the chemical   interaction is more difficult for desorption.   Chemically adsorbed molecules cannot move freely   at the interface. The bond which between the   absorbing and adsorbed, is strengthened by the   increase in temperature as in chemical reactions.   3. Ionic adsorption: The effect of electrostatic   gravitational forces between adsorbed and   adsorbent is the attachment of ions on the surface.   It is important that the adsorbing and adsorbed   materials have opposite electric charges and that   the surfaces attract each other. Electric charge and   small diameter ions are better adsorbed.    It is difficult to explain the adsorption process by   one of the types of adsorption outlined above. In   many cases, physical and chemical activation   happens together. Some substances are physically   absorbable at low temperatures and chemically at   high temperatures. In the case of many adsorptions,   different types of adsorption can be seen together   or in succession (Berkem and Baykut, 1984).      1.6 Parameters Affecting Adsorption   Some of the important parameters affecting the   adsorption process are summarized below   (Karaman, 2010, Savcı, 2010).   Surface area: Adsorption is a surface event. It is   therefore proportional to the specific surface area.   The specific surface area is defined as the part of the   total surface area suitable for adsorption. The size   of the particle size of the adsorbent is small, the   surface area is large and porous, and generally   increases the adsorption. In addition, functional   groups on the surface are also important factors   affecting the adsorption behavior of the adsorbent.   Type and properties of adsorbing and adsorb   material: Solubility of the solute in liquids is a   controlling factor for the balance of adsorption. In   general, there is an inverse relationship between   the rate of adsorption of the solute and its solubility   in the liquid phase. A water-soluble (hydrophilic)   substance is less adsorbed than water-soluble   (hydrophobic) material. Molecular size also affects   adsorption. The molecule of the size most suitable   for the pore size of the adsorbent is adsorbed   better.   pH value of the medium: pH value of the solution in   the event of adsorption is an important control   parameter. Due to the strong adsorption of H + and   OH- ions, the adsorption of other ions is affected by   the pH of the solution. In general, the adsorption   rate increases at pH where the substances are   neutral. If there is too many hydrogen or hydroxyl   ions in the environment, these ions enter the   surface with the adsorption substance ions. This   may result in less surface coating with adsorbed   substance molecules, ie less adsorption.   Temperature: Adsorption reactions are generally   exothermic, ie heat transfer reactions. Therefore,   adsorption is generally increased as the   temperature decreases. However, if the reaction is   endothermic, ie, it is a reaction that takes heat from   the environment, the adsorption will increase with   increasing temperature. Small changes in   temperature do not significantly affect the   adsorption process.

Various chemicals are used for adsorption   techniques in water treatment. Silica gel, füller soil,   pore size large resins, ion modifier resins with large   pore sizes, active silica and activated carbon are the   most well-known adsorbents.   Silica gel is a granular and porous form of silicon   dioxide synthetically produced from sodium silicate,   water and glass content. It is used in dehydration of   air and other gases, fractionation of hydrocarbons.   Molecular sieves; porous, synthetic zeolite crystals   are silver alumina silicates. They are uniform porous   and different from other adsorbents. Different   zeolites have 3-10 Å pore size.    Fuller soil (magnesium aluminum silicate);   petroleum fractions, vegetable and animal oils are   used in the purification. A porous structure is   formed by heating and drying the clay.   Activated clays; bentonite and other clays. They do   not have adsorptive properties when they are not   activated with acid (H2SO4 or HCl). After activation   with H2SO4 or HCl, the mixture is washed and dried.   It is used in particular color removal of petroleum   products by gaining a fine powdered structure.    Molecular activated carbon; custom made. 5 - 5.5 Å   (Å = 10-10 m) open pore structure. These pores can   pass paraffin hydrocarbons but do not undergo   large molecular diameter isoparaffins. Acetylene   components are used to separate alcohols, organic   acids, ketones, aldehydes. Synthetic polymeric   adsorbents (resins); They are porous spherical   particles with a diameter of 0.5 mm. Each particle is   formed by a combination of microspheres of 10-4   mm diameter.    Bauxite (hydrated Al2O3); It is used in the filtration   of oil fractions, especially in the dehydration of   gases. The adsorption capacity is increased by   increasing the temperature from 230 0C to 815 0C   in the naturally occurring form of the hydrated   alumina. It is also used in color removal of   petroleum products and drying gases.   Alumina; has a hard structure. Activated hydrated   aluminum oxide is formed which by removed   heating the moisture in its structure. The porous   product is used in granular or powder form.   Bone charcoal; It is obtained from dried coal at 600   - 900 °C. It is used for the purification of sugar, to   remove the ash from the solutions. Color relieving;   It is used in the purification, purification of organic   or inorganic substances, purification of sugar,   vegetable and animal oils.   Gas adsorbent carbon; It is obtained by   carbonization of coconut shells, fruit peels, coal,   lignite and wood. It must be activated by hot   oxidation with hot air or alum. It is used in granule   or pellet form. The recovery of solvent vapors from   gas mixtures is used to remove industrial odors, CO2   and other industrial gases, gas masks and   fractionation of hydrocarbons.   Zeolites are used in drying, separation of   hydrocarbons and in many applications. Activated   carbon; It is a microcrystalline material obtained by   thermal decomposition of wood, fruit shells and   coal. The average pore diameter, 10-60 Å surface   area is 300 - 1200 m2 / g. It is used in the adsorption   of organic substances.   Organophosphazenes were synthesized by   nucleophilic displacement reactions (SN1 or SN2)   with organic groups because the phosphorous   halogen linkage of halophosphazenes in which the   halos (F, Cl, Br) are active in the side group. The   reactions of phosphazenes with organic groups such   as alcohols, phenols, amines (primary or secondary),   thiols, organometallics, carboxylic acids and amides   have been investigated. The most studied organic   groups are alcohols, phenols and amines. The   desired substituted phosphazene compounds could   not be obtained in the reaction with carboxylic acids   and amides.    Those polyphosphazenes; There are a wide range of   applications such as medicine, microlithography,   construction of materials that delay or prevent   burning. Because polyphosphazenes; solid fibers,   films, glasses and elastomers commonly used in the   state-of-the-art technology, can serve as solid   electrodes and electronic conductors, as carriers of      Removal of Heavy Metal Ions with Phenoxy Substituted Cyclotriphosphazene Derivatives Bearing Imine, Özer et al.         571   immobilization of macromolecular biomedical   agents, chemotherapeutic agents, enzymes or   transition metal catalysts. Wide application areas   lead to a focus on polyphosphonases (Allcock,   1987).   In this study, the adsorption of A1 and A2   compounds derived from hexa (4-formyl-phenoxy)   cyclotrifosphazen and hexa (2-formylphenoxy)   cyclotrifosphazen and 4-aminophenol and 2-  aminophenol in some heavy metal-containing   aqueous solutions were investigated. The results of   the analysis revealed that imine - bearing   organophosphazenes adsorb heavy metals. The   heavy metal (Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) adsorption   property of these newly synthesized compounds   was made for the first time with this study. These   atoms were preferred because heavy metals such as   copper, iron, manganese, zinc play very important   roles in cell functions.      2.

Conclusions   Compounds Hexa [4-(4-hydroxy-  phenyliminomethyl) phenoxy] cyclotriphosphazene   (A1) and Hexa [4-(2- hydroxy- phenyliminomethyl)   phenoxy] cyclotriphosphazene (A2) which are the   imine-bearing organocyclotrifosphazen which we   use as adsorbents, were derived from hexa (4-  formylphenoxy) cyclotrifosphazen and hexa (2-  formyl-phenoxy) cyclotrifosphazen 4-aminophenol   and 2-aminophenol. The chemical structure of these   compounds is different from each other. Adsorption   is available for all metal ions.   Adsorption of metal ions of the compounds was   examined according to the time and beginning   concentration of metal ions. The selected times are   5, 10, 15,30, 50, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes. The   initial concentrations of metal ions are 50, 100, 200,   300, 400 and 500 ppm. Adsorbents 25 mg were used   in both studies. The analyzes belong to the metal   ions remaining in the solution after adsorption.   All compounds adsorbed metal ions which they   could adsorb in the first 10 minutes. After this time   it was understood that the adsorption did not take   place because the concentration of the metal ions   was constant. The least metal ion absorbed by all   compounds is Zn.   When the initial concentration of metal ions is   different the amount of metal adsorbed by the   compounds was also different. As the initial   concentration of the metal ion increases, the   proportion of the amount of metal adsorbed by the   compounds increased. Although the amount of   compounds is the same in all, the amount of   adsorption increases. The amount of metal   adsorbed then depends on the initial concentration   of the metal.   It was understood that these compounds could be   used to remove metal ions.      Acknowledgement      This study was supported by HÜBAK (Project No:   12102). We thank HÜBAK.

Introduction   The oxoanions containing multiple metal atoms are   called polyoxometalates or POMs and have been   known since the early 19th century. Berzelius   synthesized the ammonium salt of PMo12O40 3- anion,   the first compound of the POM class, in 1826   (Berzelius 1826). From then on, researchers have   synthesized POMs in new forms with different   metals. Hybrid inorganic-organic materials are   synthesized for acquiring new materials with   properties and bespoke structures. The most   remarkable advantage of hybrid inorganic-organic   materials are that they can combine dissimilar   properties of inorganic and organic components in   one material (Zhang et al. 2008, Kastner et al. 2017,   Cameron et al. 2018).

It is well-known that transition-metal-substituted   polyoxometalates are of great interest in the last   decades owing to their controlled structures. The   physical and chemical properties of different   structures are applicable to diverse areas, such as   magnetism, optics, catalysis, sensor, luminescence   and materials science (Zheng et al. 2007, Zheng et   al. 2012, Huang et al. 2014). Our aim in this study is   to synthesize structures that serve as a new model   for the design and formation of transition-metal-  substituted POM architectures.    In this paper, we reported a new hybrid compound   based on Keggin polyoxometalate. {Ni(2,2'-  bipy)2(H2O)[BW12O40]} 3- (NiBWO) is composed of   one [BW12O40] 5- anion, one [Ni(2,2'-bipy)2(H2O)]  2+   and one and a half of [Ni(2,2'-bipy)3] 2+ cations: The   structure of the synthesized compound was   characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared   Spectroscopy (FT-IR), elemental analyses, X-ray   diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric Analysis   (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-  ray single crystal diffraction analyses.   2. Materials and Methods   2.1. Chemicals    Nickel(II)chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2.6H2O) and   hydrochloric acid (HCl) were supplied by Merck.   Sodium tungstate dehydrate (Na2WO4.2H2O), boric   acid (H3BO3), 2,2'-bipyridyl (2,2'-bipy) and perchloric   acid (HClO4,)  were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.   2.2. Apparatus   Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer was   used for elemental analysis (C, N and H) of sample.   For structural analysis of the sample was measured   in the range of 4000 to 500 cm-1 using Attenuated   Total Reflection-Fourier Transformed Infrared (ATR-  FTIR) spectrometer (Perkin Elmer 100). XRD using a   Bruker axis diffractometer (Bruker D8 ADVANCE)   was used for the determination of the crystal   structure of the NiBWO. The parameters of Bruker   axis diffractometer was CuKα radiation, operating at   40 kV and 30 mA with a rate of 21°/min. Setaram   thermal gravimetric analyzer was used for thermo-  gravimetric analysis of the NiBWO over the   temperature range of 25–1000 °C under a heating   ramp of 10 °C min-1 at N2 atmosphere. SEM image   was taken on a Hitachi – SU 1510 at accelerating   voltage of 20 kV and magnification of 10.00 kX.   The hydrogen atoms bound to carbon atoms were   treated as riding atoms with distances of 0.93 Å.   Other H atoms were refined freely. In order to avoid   ADP and NPD problems, the EADP command was   used to refine the non-H atoms. With SHELXS-2013   (Sheldrick 2008), the structure of NiBWO was solved   by direct methods and refined using full-matrix   least-squares methods with SHELXL-2013 program   (Sheldrick 2015) within WinGX (Farrugia 1999). The   structural data of NiBWO was collected on Bruker   APEX2 (Bruker 2013). MERCURY program was used   for molecular graphics. Details of data collection and   crystal structure determinations are shown in Table   1. Crystallographic data of the structure has been   deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data   Center with CCDC number 1497303.   2.3. Procedure  In the synthesis of the new type of polyoxometalate,   a new low cost method is used other than the   traditional synthesis of polyoxometalates. In this   method, instead of Teflon-lined autoclave, special   production bottles and caps resistant to high   temperatures are used. Schematic representation   of the synthesis of NiBWO is given Scheme 1.   An aqueous solution of H3BO3 (1.5 mmol, 0.093 g),   Na2WO4.2H2O (3.00 mmol, 0.99 g), NiCl2.6H2O   (0.825 mmol, 0.196 g) and 2,2′-bipy (0.75 mmol,   0.117 g) was stirred at room temperature for one   hour. 6 M HCl was added to the mixture to adjusted   the pH to 1.15, then the mixture transferred in a 10   mL bottle and allowed to react at 185 °C. After seven   days, the product was slowly cooled down to room   temperature at a rate of 10 °C/h, pink crystals were   collected by filtration, washed several times with   distilled water, and dried in air (yield 59%, based on      Synthesis and Characterization of a New Nickel(II) Compound Derived from [BW12O40]3- and 2,2'-Bipyridyl, Fındık et al.         578   W).

Crystal structure   According to the result of X-ray single crystal study,   the asymmetric unit of NiBWO has been proved to   consist of one [BW12O40] 5- anion, one [Ni(2,2'-  bipy)2(H2O)] 2+ and one and a half of [Ni(2,2'-bipy)3]  2+.   [BW12O40] 5- anion with a Keggin-type structure has a   structure with a central BO4 [B-O bond distances   range of 1.53(5)–1.56(6) Å] surrounded by the   W12O36 group with tetrahedron coordination   geometry. The presence of the two types of Ni(II)   complexes {[Ni(2,2'-bipy)2(H2O)] 2+ and [Ni(2,2'-  bipy)3] 2+} is the most striking feature of NiBWO   (Figure 1). Each Ni(II) atoms of [Ni(2,2'-bipy)3] 2+   coordinated by six nitrogens from three 2,2'-bipy   ligands [Ni-N bond lengths range of 2.02(4)–2.15(4)   Å], showing a distorted octahedral geometry. The   Ni2 atom is coordinated by four nitrogens from two   2,2'-bipy ligands [Ni-N bond lengths range of   2.01(4)–2.12(4) Å], one oxygen from a coordinated   water molecule [Ni-O = 2.12(3) Å] and one oxygen   from an anion [BW12O40] 5- [Ni2-O40 = 2.03(3) Å],   exhibiting a different distorted octahedral   geometry. In other words, [Ni(2,2'-bipy)2(H2O)] 2+   should actually be described as {Ni(2,2'-  bipy)2(H2O)[BW12O40]} 3- (Figure 1). Selected bond   lengths for NiBWO (Å) are shown in Table 2.

Powder X-ray diffraction   The measured XRD curve (Figure 4) gives similar   results to the calculated model. This confirms the   purity of the crystal product. The intensity   difference may depend on the preferred direction of   the powder samples.     Figure 4. Experimental and simulated XRD curves of   NiBWO.   3.3. Infrared spectroscopy   The FT-IR spectrum of the NiBWO is shown in Figure   5. In the spectrum, the characteristic band at 948   cm−1 is attributed to W–Ot, the band at 876 cm−1 is   ascribed to W–Ob–W, the band at 754 cm−1 is due   to W–Oc and the band at 1021 cm−1 is ascribed to B–  O. The four mentioned peaks are characteristic   peaks for [BW12O40] 5- (Du et al. 2019).  The   absorption bands at 1598–1441 cm−1 are due to   vibrations of 2,2′-bipy ligand in the NiBWO (Xiao et   al. 2018).  3079 cm−1 are attributed to the vibrations   of the v(C-H) in bipy rings of the ligand (Lu et al.   2019). The peaks at ca. 3354 cm-1 are attributed to   the vibrations of v(H2O) (Lu et al. 2015).     Figure 5. FT-IR spectrum of NiBWO.   3.4. Thermogravimetric analysis   Thermal stability for the NiBWO was investigated by   TGA (Figure 6).  Firstly, 0.44% weight loss up to 165   °C corresponds to the separation of free water   molecules. These water molecules that interact   more strongly with the POM frame are separated      Synthesis and Characterization of a New Nickel(II) Compound Derived from [BW12O40]3- and 2,2'-Bipyridyl, Fındık et al.         580   from 80 to 200 °C (Canioni et al. 2011). The second   weight loss of 8.3% at 560 °C can be attributed to   the decomposition of the 2,2′-bipy (Liu et al. 2015).   The final mass loss around 880 °C (25.6%) is   attributed to the complete rupture of the remainder   POM cluster (Lan et al. 2013).     Figure 6. TGA curve of NiBWO.   3.5. SEM analysis   SEM is used to examine the three important factors   surfactant morphology (surface structural   properties based on shape and size), surface   crystallography (ie, surface formation of atoms) and   surface composition (in terms of surface   composition, compounds and elements). So, the   surface property of the NiBWO was checked by   using SEM (Figure 7). According to the SEM image,   each crystal has a cuboid structure.     Figure 7. SEM image of NiBWO.      4. Conclusion  A new organic–inorganic hybrid, {Ni(2,2'-  bipy)2(H2O)[BW12O40]} 3-, compound has been   synthesized via a simple route under hydrothermal   conditions through carefully tuning the reaction   temperature. The use of high temperature bottles   used in the synthesis method may be preferred by   the researchers in terms of decreasing the cost in   subsequent studies. The compound was   characterized by X-ray diffraction method, FT-IR   spectra and TGA. These analyzes support the results   from the single crystal X-ray structural analysis.   According to the X-ray, the compound is based on   Keggin polyoxoanions.

Introduction   It is important to integrate and solve nonlinear   partial derivative differential equations that   contain derivative by time, which is encountered in   many fields of science. Recently, many studies in   order to obtain solutions of the partial differential   equations is made. We can use the concept of   wave to make the solutions of such equations   understandable. These nonlinear events   encountered in nature are very common in the   fields of fluid mechanics, plasma physics, optical   fibers, solid state physics, biology, chemical   kinematics, chemical physics, geochemistry and   engineering. A single (solitary) wave is a wave that   spreads without changing over time when it moves   along with the current speed of the wave in the   environment in which it occurs. We know that the   application areas of the waves are quite high. For   this reason, many different powerful and effective   methods have been developed by different   scientists, allowing exact solutions of nonlinear                  Afyon Kocatepe Üniversitesi Fen ve Mühendislik Bilimleri Dergisi    Afyon Kocatepe University Journal of Science and  Engineering    http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0274-7901 mailto:turalagir@yahoo.com http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1521-7873   New Exact Solutions of Cubic Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation by Using Extended Trial Equation Method, Pandır and Ağır   583      partial differential equations. As a result of these   new developed methods, many physical events will   be easier to understand with the determination of   the new exact solution functions. Therefore, many   different approach methods have been proposed   and developed. Sine-cosine method Wang (1996),   Wazwaz (2008), Hirota's bilinear transformation   method Hietarinta (1997), Pashaev and Tanoglu   (2005), ( )/G G -expansion method Akbar et al   (2013), Shakeel and Mohyud-Din (2015), trial   equation method Liu (2006), Liu (2010), Gurefe et   al.

(2013) can   be given as an example for the proposed and   developed complete solution methods.   In 2005, Liu C.S., proposed a powerful method to   find complete solutions of nonlinear partial   differential differential equations. Here, its main   purpose was to find the solutions of an ordinary   differential equation whose solution is not known   by using different integration methods and to   obtain the solutions of the equations with the finite   series solution function that includes the functions   consisting of them. Later, with the development of   this proposed powerful method, different versions   were brought into the literature by many scientists   (Gurefe et al. 2011, Gurefe et al. 2012). Recently,   the proposed method by Liu has been further   developed and introduced into the literature as an   extended trial equation method by Gürefe et al   (Pandir et al. 2012, Pandir et al. 2013, Gurefe et al.   2013). This extended trial equation method   developed has enabled the acquisition of new and   exact solutions of the nonlinear partial differential   equations.    In this study the developed method is applied to   the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation. By   creating the algorithms required for the extended   trial equation method and writing the codes   according to the created algorithm, new different   exact solutions of the equation which is not found   in the literature was obtained. In the next section,   the extended trial equation method is described in   detail.   2. Extended Trial Equation Method   In this section, it is aimed to find new exact   solutions of the nonlinear partial differential   equations with the extended trial equation method   developed based on the trial equation method. The   outlines of the extended trial equation method are   expressed in detail. Let's suppose the general form   of a nonlinear partial differential equation with   independent variables , , ,...,x y z t  as    ( ), , , ..., ,..., , , ,..., ,... 0.x y z t xx xy xz xtu u u u u u u u u =    (1)   The travelling wave transformation is used for the   Eq.(1) as follows   ( ) ( )  1 2 3  , , , , ,  ... m  u x y z t u  e x e y e z e t      =  = + + + +       (2)     where ( )0 1,2,3,...,je j m = . Substituting Eq. (2)   into Eq. (1) reduces a nonlinear ordinary   differential equation   ( ), ', '', ''',... 0.R u u u u =      (3)   Let's consider the solution of the Eq. (3) with the   finite series approach as follows   ( ) ( ) 0  i  i  i  u      =  =      (4)   where    ( ) ( ) ( )  ( )  2 2 0 1 2  2  0 1 2  .                   + +  + +   =   = =    + +  +              (5)   Here the ( )  functions are the solution functions   of the nonlinear ordinary elliptical differential   equation. Using Eq (4) and Eq (5), we can write   ( ) ( ) ( )  ( ) ( )  2  2 1  0  i  i  i  u i      −  =       =             (6)       New Exact Solutions of Cubic Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation by Using Extended Trial Equation Method, Pandır and Ağır   584      ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )  ( ) ( )  ( )  ( ) ( ) ( )  1  2 0  2  0  2  1  i  i  i  i  i  i  u i  i i             −  =  −  =       −     =        + −                    (7)   where ( )   and ( )   are polynomials. When   the obtained derivatives in Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) are   examined, as stated in the solution function (4)   turns into a polynomial expression linked to a   rational ( )  function. The balance procedure   according to Eq. (3) is applied in terms of the   polynomial equivalent of the highest-order (non-  linear) term with the highest-order derivative term.   With the balancing procedure,   in solution   function (4),   and   values in Eq. (5) will be  calculated. Some balancing terms are calculated as   follows    2 2 uu   + −− →  , ( ) 2 2 2  u  + −− →  ,   2 2 u   → ,   3 3 .u   →        (8)   Thus, when the calculated values are written in   place of the expressions, zero polynomial related   to the   function is obtained. A system of   algebraic equations is obtained by synchronizing   the related terms in this zero polynomial to zero.   When the created algebraic equation system is   solved with the help of Mathematica 10 package   program, 0 , ,   , 0 , ,   and 0 , ,      coefficients are obtained. When the obtained   coefficients are replaced in the Eq. (5), ( )    functions are obtained by calculating the integral   ( ) ( )  ( )  ( ) 0  . d  d      − = =           (9)    Then, ( )  functions are replaced in solution   function (4), respectively. Thus, by applying the   transformation in the expression of (2) to the   obtained    ( )u   functions, new exact solutions of   the Eq. (1) are obtained.    3. Application of the Extended Trial Equation   Method      In this section, the extended trial equation method   is applied to the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger   equation. The cubic nonlinear Schrödinger   equation is one of the most important universal   nonlinear models that naturally occur in many   physical systems. It is a general equation that   occurs when a semi-monochromatic wave   propagates in a diffuse and weakly nonlinear   environment. It has also been used in   hydrodynamics to describe various physical   phenomena, especially in nonlinear optical fibers,   heat transfer in a solid, nonlinear waves in a fluid-  filled elastic tube, nonlinear imbalance problems,   and solitary wave propagation in piezoelectric   semiconductors (Imanli 2006, Sulem and Sulem   1999, Ablowitz et al. 2004). The most general form   of the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation is   2 2  2 0,  w w i k w w  t x    + + =       (10)   where w  is a complex valued function and k  is a   real arbitrary parameter (Chand and Malik 2012,   Kaplan et al. 2016). First let's assume travelling   wave transformation to apply the extended trial   equation method to Eq. (10)   ( ) ( ), , ,iw x t e w mx nt lx ct   = = + = +    where , , ,m n l c  are arbitrary constants.   Derivatives and the unknown function in the Eq.

(10), a non-  linear 3rd order ordinary differential equation is   obtained   ( )2 3 3 2 0,c m w k w l w− − + + =  (12)     New Exact Solutions of Cubic Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation by Using Extended Trial Equation Method, Pandır and Ağır   585      where 2 .n lm=  Using the solution function (4) and   differential equation (5), the related derivatives are   calculated and replaced in Eq. (12). The balancing   procedure is applied to determine the  ,   and     values in solution function (4) and differential   equation (5). According to the extended trial   equation method, the balance process is   determined between the term ''w containing the   highest order derivative and the highest order   nonlinear term  3  w  for Eq. (12) as follows   3 3 w   → ,   2 .w   + −− →   (13)   Accordingly, the balance term is obtained as   2 2  = + +  from the equivalence of the   obtained  3  w w   terms.   To determine the new solution of the Eq. (10), if   the balance terms are selected as 0 = and 1 = ,   then 4 =  is obtained. When these balancing   terms are written in solution function (4) and   differential equation (5) respectively, we acquire    ( ) ( )0 1 ,w    = +       (14)   ( ) ( )  ( )  2 3 4 2 0 1 2 3 4  0  .           + +  +  +   = =     (15)   The term w  in the Eq.

(12), a polynomial expression based on the   ( )  function occurs. If we consider this   polynomial as a zero polynomial, the coefficients of   this polynomial are equalized to zero, resulting in a   system of algebraic equations.   When this algebraic system is solved with the help   of Mathematica 10 packet program, coefficients   are found as follows            3  3 2 3 4 0 0 1 2 2 3 3 4 42  4  4 , , , , ,  8                  − = = − = = =  2 2  3 4 0 0 0 0 12  4 0 3  4 , , ,  8  l  k             = − = =    2 22 4 02  3  8 3 .c m k          = − + −              (17)   When these obtained coefficients are replaced in   Eq.

Conclusion   In this paper, the extended trial equation method   has been used to obtain a new exact solutions of   the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation. This   method makes it possible to achieve the rational   function solutions, travelling wave solution, soliton   solution and an Jacobi elliptic function solution. We   suppose that this method can also be implemented   to other nonlinear differential equations.      10 5 5 10  2  1  1  2  20 10 10 20  1.0  0.5  0.5  1.0  5 5  3  2  1  1  2  3    New Exact Solutions of Cubic Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation by Using Extended Trial Equation Method, Pandır and Ağır   588      5.
